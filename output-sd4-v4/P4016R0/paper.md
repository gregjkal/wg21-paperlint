## Abstract

C++	today	offers	two	endpoints	for	reduction:

- std::accumulate :	a	specified	left-fold	expression,	inherently	sequential.
- std::reduce :	scalable,	but	permits	reassociation;	for	non-associative	operations	(e.g.,	floating-point	addition),	the returned	value	may	differ	across	conforming	evaluations.

This	paper	specifies	a canonical	reduction	expression	structure :	for	a	given	input	order	and	topology	coordinate (lane	count L ),	the	expression	-	its	parenthesization	and	operand	order	(hereafter,	the abstract	expression )	-	is unique	and	fully	specified.	Implementations	are	free	to	schedule	evaluation	using	parallelization,	vectorization,	or any	other	strategy,	provided	the	returned	value	matches	that	of	the	specified	expression.

The	proposal	standardizes	the	expression	structure	only.	API	design	is	deferred.

The	approach	generalizes	a	technique	already	present	in	the	Standard	Library: std::accumulate obtains determinism	by	fixing	its	abstract	expression	structure,	not	by	constraining	execution	strategy	or	floating-point arithmetic	(see	Appendix	D).	Bitwise	identity	of	results	additionally	depends	on	the	floating-point	evaluation	model (§6).

Reading	guide. The	key	decision	points	are	captured	in	the Polls	for	LEWG	Direction (immediately	following	this guide).	The	normative	content	of	this	paper	is	§4-§5	(~8	pages).	Everything	else	is	informative	rationale	and appendices.

Direction	requested	(this	R0). This	paper	asks	whether	the	standard	library	should	provide	a canonical reduction	semantic	contract :	for	a	given	input	order	and	semantic	parameter L ,	the	algorithm	denotes	a single fixed	abstract	expression (specified	in	§4-§5).	Implementations	may	execute	using	threads/SIMD/workstealing/GPU	kernels,	but	must	produce	results as-if	evaluating	that	abstract	expression .

Non-goals. This	revision	does	not	standardize	arithmetic	determinism	(rounding	mode,	contraction,	FTZ/DAZ,	etc.), and	it	does	not	propose	final	API	naming,	placement,	or	overload	sets.

Where	to	look. The	normative	semantics	are	in	§4-§5;	the	remainder	provides	motivation,	design-space	discussion, and	validation	evidence.

## Polls	for	LEWG	Direction

[ Note: The	polls	below	are	written	for	LEWG	review.	When	presented	to	SG6,	the	chair	may	rephrase	polls	to	focus on	numerics-specific	concerns	-	for	example,	whether	the	canonical	tree	structure	is	appropriate	for	floating-point error	analysis,	whether	the	lane	count	parameter	is	a	suitable	topology	coordinate	for	numerical	reproducibility,	and whether	the GENERALIZED\_NONCOMMUTATIVE\_SUM / GENERALIZED\_SUM distinction	is	correctly	handled. -end	note ]

Vote	categories	for	all	polls: Strongly	Favor	/	Weakly	Favor	/	Neutral	/	Weakly	Against	/	Strongly	Against

## Poll	1	-	Semantics-first	scope	(direction)

Question: We	agree	that	the	C++	Standard	Library	lacks	a	parallel	reduction	facility	with	a	specified	abstract expression,	that	this	is	a	gap	worth	closing,	and	that	validating	the	expression	structure	before	committing	to	API design	is	the	right	approach	for	this	facility.	We	direct	the	authors	to	focus	this	revision	on	the	semantic	model	and return	with	a	separate	paper	for	API	surface	if	the	semantic	direction	is	positive.

Vote: Strongly	Favor	/	Weakly	Favor	/	Neutral	/	Weakly	Against	/	Strongly	Against

Poll	2	-	Approve	the	semantic	framework	(fixed	abstract	expression)

Question: We	agree	that	a	canonical	reduction	facility	should	define	a	single	fixed	abstract	expression	for	a	given input	order	and	semantic	parameters	(including	lane	count L ),	and	that	the	two-stage	structure	in	§4	(interleaved lane	partition,	per-lane	canonical	tree,	cross-lane	canonical	tree)	is	a	suitable	framework	for	this	contract. Implementations	may	execute	using	threads/SIMD/work-stealing/GPU	kernels,	but	must	produce	results	as-if evaluating	the	specified	abstract	expression.	This	poll	is	about	the	framework;	the	specific	tree	shape	is	considered separately	in	Poll	2A.

[ Note: Init	placement	is	specified	in	§4.5;	if	desired,	LEWG	can	poll	init	placement	separately. -end	note ]

Vote: Strongly	Favor	/	Weakly	Favor	/	Neutral	/	Weakly	Against	/	Strongly	Against

## Poll	2A	-	Tentative	preference	for	the	canonical	tree	shape

Question: Assuming	Poll	2	passes,	we	have	a	tentative	preference	that	the	canonical	tree	shape	be	the	iterative pairwise	('binary-counter	/	carry')	tree	described	in	§4.2.3,	on	the	grounds	that	it	is	deterministic,	SIMD/MT/GPU implementable,	and	has	clean	ragged-tail	handling	without	requiring	identity	elements.

[ Note: Recursive	bisection	('balanced')	was	considered	as	an	alternative	tree	construction.	It	is	documented	in Appendix	O	(informative)	for	comparison	and	historical	record. -end	note ]

If	consensus	is	not	reached	on	tree	shape,	the	two-stage	semantic	framework	(Poll	2)	remains	valid;	authors	will return	with	a	follow-up	comparing	tree	shape	alternatives.

Vote: Strongly	Favor	/	Weakly	Favor	/	Neutral	/	Weakly	Against	/	Strongly	Against

## Poll	3	-	Proceed	to	API	surface	(conditional	direction)

Question: If	Poll	2	is	positive,	we	direct	the	authors	to	return	with	a	proposed	API	surface	(names,	signatures, constraints,	header	placement),	preserving	the	Poll	2	semantic	contract.

Scope	of	expected	API	revision:

- New	algorithm	and/or	execution	policy	approach
- Proposed	naming	and	header	placement
- Initial	overload	set	(iterators/ranges,	with/without	execution	policy)
- Constraints	and	mandates
- Topology	selection	mechanism	(including	any	named	presets	and	defaulting	rules)

Vote: Strongly	Favor	/	Weakly	Favor	/	Neutral	/	Weakly	Against	/	Strongly	Against

## 0.	Executive	Overview

There	is	a	gap	in	the	C++	Standard	Library.	Sequential	reductions	( std::accumulate )	have	a	fully	specified	abstract expression	structure	-	and	their	returned	value	is	defined	by	that	structure	-	but	cannot	be	parallelized.	Parallel reductions	( std::reduce )	can	be	parallelized	but	leave	the	expression	unspecified:	for	non-associative	operations such	as	floating-point	addition,	both	the	order	in	which	operands	are	combined	and	how	they	are	grouped (parenthesized)	may	produce	different	observable	results	for	the	same	input	solely	due	to	execution	strategy selection.

This	proposal	addresses	that	gap.	It	specifies	an	interleaved	binary	reduction	tree	in	two	stages.	The	input	is distributed	across L parallel	lanes	(where L is	a	user-chosen	lane	count,	typically	matching	SIMD	width);	each	lane	is independently	reduced	by	an	iterated	near-balanced	binary	tree	(Stage	1),	and	the L lane	results	are	combined	by the	same	tree	rule	(Stage	2).	The	lane	count L is	a	semantic	topology	coordinate;	choosing	it	to	match	hardware SIMD	width	is	optional	guidance,	not	required.	The	tree	is	built	bottom-up,	permitting	implementations	to	begin evaluation	incrementally	as	elements	arrive;	however,	the	returned	value	is	defined	with	respect	to	the	completed input	range	of	length N .	Streaming	is	an	implementation	technique	only;	the	specified	abstract	expression	is	defined over	the	final	input	sequence	of	length N .	Fixing	the	parenthesization	and	operand	order	gives	a	fixed	abstract expression	(expression	identity)	that	makes	results	reproducible	for	a	fixed	input	order,	topology	coordinate L ,	and floating-point	evaluation	model.	Implementations	remain	free	to	schedule	evaluation	using	threads,	SIMD,	or	GPU kernels,	provided	the	returned	value	matches	the	specified	expression.	API	design	is	deferred;	this	paper	seeks validation	of	the	expression	structure	only.	No	changes	to	existing	algorithms	are	proposed	in	this	revision.

## What	this	paper	adds

- Fixed	abstract	expression	for	parallel	reduction,	parameterized	by	lane	count L .
- Two-stage	semantic	structure:	per-lane	tree	+	cross-lane	tree.
- Execution	remains	unconstrained;	only	the	expression	is	specified.

## What	this	paper	does	not	do

- Guarantee	cross-architecture	bitwise	identity	(requires	matching L and	floating-point	model;	see	§6).
- Constrain	execution,	scheduling,	or	parallelism.
- Propose	a	final	API	surface.

## 1.	The	Semantic	Gap	in	C++	Reduction	Facilities

The	table	in	§1.1	classifies	existing	reduction	facilities	by	expression	ownership	-	whether	the	Standard	fully specifies	the	abstract	expression	or	leaves	it	(partially	or	wholly)	unspecified.	The	proposed	canonical	reduction completes	the	family	by	providing	a	specified	expression	that	admits	parallel	evaluation.

[ Note: In	this	paper, canonical refers	strictly	to	the	abstract	expression	structure.	The	terms	'canonical expression,'	'canonical	tree,'	and	'canonical	reduction'	are	used	interchangeably	to	refer	to	the	fixed	abstract expression	defined	in	§4.	Implementations	retain	freedom	in	evaluation	schedule;	the	facility	provides	a	stable, specified	baseline	topology.	The	term	'canonical'	is	descriptive	and	carries	no	relation	to std::filesystem::canonical ;	the	facility	may	be	named specified\_reduce , deterministic\_reduce ,	or	otherwise	in	an API	revision. -end	note ]

This	work	was	presented	to	SG14	(Low	Latency/Games/Embedded/Financial	Trading),	who	encouraged	a	formal paper.	The	approach	has	been	validated	with	working	implementations	across	x86	AVX2,	ARM	NEON,	and	CUDA (Appendix	K),	producing	expression-identical	results	for	fixed	topology	coordinates	(bitwise-identical	under sufficiently	aligned	floating-point	evaluation	environments;	see	§6).	A	summary	comparison	with	HPC	frameworks and	industry	practice	appears	in	§7.

## 1.1	Why	This	Needs	to	Be	in	the	Standard	Library

Parallel	algorithms	literature	commonly	identifies	a	small	set	of	fundamental	primitives	for	combining	elements	of	a sequence,	notably	reduction	and	scan	(prefix	computation)	[Blelloch1989].	These	primitives	are	defined	in	terms	of combining	values	using	a	binary	operation	over	an	ordered	sequence.

The	C++	Standard	Library	provides	corresponding	facilities:

- std::accumulate ,	which	combines	all	values	in	a	sequence,
- std::inclusive\_scan and std::exclusive\_scan ,	which	compute	prefix	combinations	of	values,	and
- std::reduce ,	which	combines	all	values	in	a	sequence	and	permits	parallel	execution.

These	facilities	provide	different	guarantees	about	the	order	in	which	operations	are	performed. std::accumulate specifies	that	values	are	combined	from	left	to	right,	fully	determining	the	abstract	expression. std::inclusive\_scan and std::exclusive\_scan preserve	operand	order	but	permit	reassociation	(arbitrary	parenthesization). std::reduce , by	contrast,	permits	implementations	to	both	reorder	operands	and	reassociate	to	enable	parallel	execution.

This	leads	to	the	following	distinction:

The	Standard	already	provides	expression	ownership	for	sequential	reduction	( accumulate )	and	preserves	operand order	for	parallel	prefix	computation	(scan).	Parallel	reduction	is	the	remaining	primitive	for	which	no	specified expression	exists.	This	proposal	completes	that	family.

The	standard	defines	the GENERALIZED\_NONCOMMUTATIVE\_SUM and GENERALIZED\_SUM specification	models	in [numerics.defns]. GENERALIZED\_NONCOMMUTATIVE\_SUM preserves	operand	order	but	allows	arbitrary	parenthesization (the	split	point	K	is	unspecified). GENERALIZED\_SUM additionally	permits	operand	reordering.

[ Note: Section	references	such	as	[numerics.defns]	refer	to	the	C++	Working	Draft;	draft	number	at	the	time	of writing:	N5032. -end	note ]

Sequential	reduction	specifies	a	unique	expression.	Parallel	prefix	algorithms	(scan)	preserve	operand	order	but admit	multiple	conforming	parenthesizations.	Parallel	reduction	( std::reduce )	is	unique	among	these	primitives:	it specifies	neither	operand	order	nor	parenthesization	-	two	independent	semantic	freedoms	that	together	make	the abstract	expression	fully	unspecified.

For	operations	that	are	not	associative,	such	as	floating-point	addition,	different	orders	of	combination	may	produce different	results.	Controlling	the	floating-point	evaluation	model	alone	is	therefore	insufficient	to	ensure reproducible	parallel	reduction:	without	a	specified	order	of	combination,	different	valid	implementations	of std::reduce may	compute	different	results	for	the	same	input.

This	proposal	introduces	a	parameter	L	that	selects	a	specified	grouping	and	operand	order	for	combining	values during	parallel	reduction.	For	a	fixed	input	sequence	and	chosen	L,	conforming	implementations	must	produce	the same	result	as	if	the	values	were	combined	in	that	specified	order,	while	remaining	free	to	evaluate	those combinations	using	parallel	execution	strategies.	Providing	such	a	facility	enables	portable	parallel	reduction	with well-defined	evaluation	semantics,	analogous	to	those	already	provided	for	prefix	algorithms.

Why	this	cannot	be	achieved	outside	the	standard. This	facility	cannot	be	obtained	merely	as	an	external wrapper	around	existing	standard	components. std::reduce explicitly	permits	reassociation	(and,	under GENERALIZED\_SUM ,	operand	reordering);	no	wrapper,	view,	or	range	adaptor	can	remove	those	permissions	while	still using std::reduce as	the	semantic	basis.	A	standalone	library	can	of	course	provide	its	own	fixed-tree	reduction algorithm,	but	it	cannot	retroactively	change	what	the	Standard	specifies	for std::reduce ,	nor	can	it	provide	a	single portable standard contract	that	all	standard	execution	mechanisms	are	required	to	honor.	Standardization	provides that	common,	portable	semantic	foundation	-	a	specified	abstract	expression	-	that	library	and	framework	authors can	target.

Heterogeneous	execution. Modern	C++	programs	increasingly	execute	on	heterogeneous	platforms	-	CPU threads,	GPU	kernels,	and	accelerators	within	a	single	application.	The	sender/receiver	model	(P2300)	enables scheduling	work	to	different	executors,	but	without	a	standardized	expression	structure,	the	same	reduction dispatched	to	different	devices	may	produce	different	results	simply	because	each	executor	chooses	a	different grouping.	By	fixing	the	abstract	expression	in	the	standard,	this	proposal	provides	a	common	expression	contract across	executors;	returned	values	match	when	floating-point	evaluation	conditions	are	sufficiently	aligned	and	the same	topology	coordinate L is	selected	(see	§6).

## 1.2	Motivating	example	(informative)

Consider	the	same	6	floating-point	inputs	evaluated	with	the	same + operator:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Because	floating-point	addition	is	not	associative,	different	parenthesizations	can	legitimately	produce	different results.

[ Note: This	example	is	illustrative;	the	exact	numeric	outcomes	depend	on	the	floating-point	evaluation	conditions	in effect	(see	§6). -end	note ]

- A left-to-right	fold (as	with std::accumulate )	groups	as (((((1e16	+	1)	+	1)	+	-1e16)	+	1)	+	1) which	yields 4 on	IEEE-754	double	implementations	with	round-to-nearest,	because	small	terms	can	survive	until	after	the large	cancellation.
- A	plausible tree	reduction (as	may	happen	inside std::reduce )	can	group	as ((1e16	+	1)	+	(1	+	-1e16))	+	(1 +	1) ,	in	which	some +1 terms	are	lost	early,	yielding 2 under	the	same	rounding	mode.

Today,	both	outcomes	are	consistent	with	the	Standard	because std::reduce does	not	fix	the	abstract	expression	(it requires	associativity/commutativity	to	be	well-defined).	This	paper's	goal	is	to	define	a single	standard-fixed expression ('canonical')	so	that	the	returned	value	is	reproducible	within	a	fixed	consistency	domain	(fixed	input order,	fixed	topology	coordinate L ,	and	a	fixed	floating-point	evaluation	model),	while	still	permitting	parallel execution.

Appendix	K.3.1	provides	a	cancellation-heavy	dataset	in	which std::reduce exhibits	run-to-run	variability	while	the canonical	reduction	stays	stable	for	fixed L ,	and	in	which	varying L intentionally	yields	different	results	(confirming that	topology	selection	is	semantic,	not	a	hint).

## 1.3	Determinism	via	Expression	Ownership	in	Existing	Practice

std::accumulate is	the	clearest	precedent.	Its	specification	mandates	a	left-to-right	fold,	fully	determining	the abstract	expression.	Consequently,	implementations	are	not	permitted	to	reassociate	operations,	even	when	the supplied binary\_op is	non-associative.	This	guarantee	is	structural,	not	numerical:	the	Standard	does	not	promise bitwise	identity	across	platforms	or	builds,	but	it	does	fully	specify	the	expression	being	evaluated.

This	proposal	applies	the	same	structural	technique	to	parallel	reduction:	it	standardizes	a	single	canonical expression	that	admits	parallel	evaluation.	Appendix	D	analyzes	the std::accumulate precedent	in	detail.

## 2.	Scope	and	Non-Goals

This	paper	proposes semantics	only .	It	seeks	LEWG	validation	of	the	fixed	expression	structure	defined	in	§4 before	committing	to	API	design.	This	proposal	introduces	no algebraic requirements	on binary\_op (associativity/commutativity/identity).	Iterator/type	constraints	and	API	surface	are	deferred;	the	semantic requirements	on binary\_op are	captured	normatively	in	§4-§5.

This	facility	differs	from std::reduce composed	with	an	execution	policy: std::reduce deliberately	leaves	the abstract	expression	unspecified	regardless	of	policy	(§1),	whereas	this	paper	standardizes	a	single	fixed	canonical expression	for	a	chosen	topology	coordinate.

The	facility	defines	the	returned	value	for	a	chosen	topology	coordinate	(lane	count L ).	Execution	strategy	remains unconstrained	(§4).

Reproducibility	under	this	facility	is	defined	relative	to	a	chosen	topology	coordinate L .	Different	topology	selections intentionally	define	different	abstract	expressions	and	may	therefore	produce	different	results	for	non-associative operations.	Determinism	is	guaranteed	for	a	fixed	input	sequence,	fixed	topology	coordinate L ,	and	fixed	floatingpoint	evaluation	model.

For	clarity:	§4-§5	define	the	semantic	contract	of	the	facility.	Other	sections	and	appendices	provide	rationale, motivation,	and	alignment	notes	with	existing	Standard	Library	rules;	they	are	not	intended	to	introduce independent	semantic	requirements	beyond	what	is	stated	in	§4-§5.	Appendix	K	records	external	demonstrator programs	(Compiler	Explorer	links)	used	to	validate	the	semantics	on	multiple	architectures;	they	are	semantic witnesses,	not	reference	implementations	and	not	part	of	the	proposal.

## In	scope	(this	paper):

- Semantic	definition	of	the	canonical	reduction	expression	(fixed	abstract	expression)
- Parameterization	by	lane	count L (§9)
- Invariance	guarantees	(§5)
- Rationale	for	design	choices

## Deferred	to	later	revision	(pending	LEWG	direction):

- API	surface	(new	algorithm	vs	execution	policy	vs	both)
- Range-based	overloads
- Scheduler/executor	integration	(sender/receiver-based	execution	models)

Scan	and	reduce	differ	in	their	degree	of	nondeterminism. The	nondeterminism	admitted	by	scan	algorithms is	strictly	weaker	than	that	admitted	by std::reduce .	Scan	preserves	the	operand	sequence	and	permits	only reassociation	of	the	binary	operation	(via GENERALIZED\_NONCOMMUTATIVE\_SUM ).	By	contrast, std::reduce additionally permits	reordering	of	operands	( GENERALIZED\_SUM ).	A	canonical	reduction	(§4)	therefore	fixes	two	dimensions	of variation	(operand	order	and	parenthesization),	while	a	corresponding	scan	facility	would	need	to	fix	only parenthesization	for	each	prefix.

Related	algorithms	(informative). Because	scan	algorithms	already	preserve	operand	order	([numerics.defns]: GENERALIZED\_NONCOMMUTATIVE\_SUM ),	applying	the	tree	rule	(§4)	independently	to	each	prefix	yields	a	deterministic scan	without	introducing	a	lane	parameter.	The	missing	semantic	in	scan	is	therefore	limited	to	fixed parenthesization;	the	reduction	defined	in	this	paper	provides	the	necessary	machinery.	A	future canonical\_scan would	apply	a	standard-fixed	grouping	to	each	prefix	in	sequence	order;	unlike	reduction,	this	must	not	permute operands.	Scan	is	out	of	scope	for	this	paper.

## 2.1	Opt-in	reproducibility	and	performance	trade-off	(informative)

This	facility	is	an opt-in choice	for	users	who	require	a	stable,	specified	abstract	expression	structure	(e.g.,	for debugging,	verification,	regression	testing,	or	reproducible	numerical	workflows).	It	is	not	intended	to	replace existing	high-throughput	facilities.	Users	who	prioritize	maximum	throughput	over	expression	identity	should continue	to	use std::reduce (or	domain-specific	facilities)	where	unspecified	reassociation	is	acceptable.

## 2.2	Traversal	and	sizing	requirements	(informative)

Evaluation	of	the	canonical	expression	requires	a	well-defined N (the	number	of	elements	in	the	input	range).	The normative	definition	(§4)	is	stated	in	terms	of K	=	ceil(N/L) ,	but N need	not	be	known	in	advance:	the	iterative pairwise	(shift-reduce)	evaluation	strategy	consumes	elements	incrementally	in	a	single	pass,	discovering N when the	input	is	exhausted	and	completing	the	canonical	tree	at	that	point.	No	implicit	materialization	or	allocation	is performed	by	the	facility.

However,	the	expression	is	defined	for	the	completed	range	of	length N ;	implementations	may	consume	elements incrementally	(streaming)	provided	the	returned	value	equals	that	of	the	canonical	expression	for	that	final N (see §3.8	for	architectural	discussion).	See	Appendix	L	for	further	discussion	of	ranges	compatibility.

## 2.3	Exception	safety

Informative	summary: intended	to	align	with	existing	rules	in [algorithms.parallel.exceptions] ;	the	semantic contract	for	returned	values	remains	§4-§5.

Exception	handling	follows	the	corresponding	Standard	Library	rules	for	the	selected	evaluation	mode:

- When	evaluated	without	an	execution	policy,	if binary\_op throws,	the	exception	is	propagated	to	the	caller (standard	sequential	semantics).
- When	evaluated	with	an	execution	policy	(including execution::seq , execution::par , execution::unseq ,	or execution::par\_unseq ):	if	execution	of binary\_op exits	via	an	uncaught	exception, std::terminate is	called.

The	expression-equivalence	(returned-value)	guarantee	applies	only	when	evaluation	completes	normally.	If std::terminate is	called	under	a	policy-based	evaluation,	the	state	of	any	outputs	and	any	externally	observable	side effects	is	unspecified.

## 2.4	Complexity

Informative	summary: intended	to	be	consistent	with [reduce] ;	this	summary	is	non-normative	(API	wording	is deferred).

Evaluation	of	the	canonical	reduction	for	an	input	range	of N elements	performs O(N) applications	of binary\_op . Specifically,	the	canonical	expression	contains	exactly N	-	1 applications	of binary\_op when N	>	0 (the	init combination	in	§4.5,	if	present,	adds	one	additional	application);	absent-operand	positions	(§4.2.2)	do	not	induce additional	applications.

This	matches	the	work	complexity	required	of std::reduce .	This	paper	specifies	work	complexity	only;	depth	and storage	are	not	normative.	The	abstract	expression	has	O(log	N)	height;	this	paper	does	not	require implementations	to	realize	that	depth	without	auxiliary	storage.	No	guarantees	are	made	about	evaluation	depth, degree	of	parallelism,	or	auxiliary	storage.

[ Note: The	natural	shift-reduce	evaluation	strategy	(§4.2.3)	maintains	a	stack	of	depth	O(log	K)	per	lane,	where	K	= ceil(N/L).	For	L	lanes	this	implies	O(L	·	log(N/L))	intermediate	values	of	type	A	as	working	storage.	This	is	modest	in practice	(e.g.,	8	lanes	×	30	stack	entries	for	a	billion	elements)	but	is	not	zero. -end	note ]

## 2.5	Expression	identity	vs.	bitwise	identity

This	facility	guarantees expression	identity :	for	fixed	input	order	and	topology	coordinate,	the	abstract	reduction expression	is	identical	across	conforming	implementations.	Bitwise	identity	of	results	additionally	depends	on	the floating-point	evaluation	model;	§6	discusses	the	distinction	in	detail.

This	facility	introduces	no	additional	guarantees	regarding	floating-point	rounding	behavior,	contraction	(e.g.,	FMA), extended	precision,	or	evaluation	environment	beyond	those	already	permitted	by	the	C++	Standard.

## 2.6	Constant	evaluation

When	evaluated	in	a	constant-evaluation	context,	the	returned	value	is	as-if	obtained	by	evaluating	the	canonical abstract	expression	defined	in	§4.	Constant	evaluation	does	not	require	parallelism.	The	expression	is	a	pure functional	specification	with	no	dependence	on	runtime	state,	so	it	is	structurally	amenable	to	constant	evaluation provided binary\_op is	itself	usable	in	constant	expressions.	Detailed constexpr specification	(including	iterator constraints)	is	deferred	to	the	API	design	paper.

## 2.7	Freestanding

The	canonical	reduction	requires	no	heap	allocation	and	uses	no	heap	allocation;	typical	working	storage	is	O(L	· log(N/L))	intermediate	values	of	type	A.	It	is	a	candidate	for	freestanding	implementations;	detailed	freestanding specification	is	deferred	to	the	API	design	paper.

## 3.	Design	Space	(Informative)

This	section	catalogs	key	design	alternatives	for	a	reproducible	reduction	facility	and	explains	why	this	proposal chooses	a	user-selectable,	interleaved-lane	topology	with	a	standard-defined	canonical	expression.

The	goal	is	to	close	the	'grouping	gap'	for	parallel	reductions	by	providing	a	facility	that:

1.  Specifies	a	single	abstract	expression	(parenthesization	and	operand	order)	for	a	chosen	topology.
2.  Achieves	scalable	depth	(O(log	N))	suitable	for	parallel	execution.
3.  Is	topology-stable:	the	expression	is	not	implicitly	determined	by	thread	count	or	implementation	strategy.
4.  Remains	implementable	efficiently	on	modern	hardware	(SIMD,	multicore,	GPU).

The	following	alternatives	are	evaluated	against	these	requirements.

## 3.0	Expression,	Algorithm,	and	Execution

Every	reduction	computes	an abstract	expression :	a	parenthesized	combination	of	operands	with	a	defined	left/right operand	order.	This	expression	exists	independently	of	how	it	is	evaluated	in	time.	In	C++,	the	abstract	expression has	historically	been	implicit	-	specified	only	indirectly	through	algorithm	wording	-	and	has	never	been	named	as a	distinct	semantic	concern.

In	practice,	three	concerns	determine	the	behavior	of	a	reduction:

- Expression	structure -	the	abstract	computation	being	performed:	grouping,	parenthesization,	and	operand order.
- Algorithm -	the	semantic	contract	that	determines	which	aspects	of	the	expression	are	specified	or intentionally	left	unspecified.
- Execution -	how	evaluation	of	the	expression	is	scheduled:	sequentially,	in	parallel,	vectorized,	or	otherwise.

The	C++	Standard	Library	already	relies	on	this	separation	but	does	not	articulate	it	explicitly.	As	a	result, expression	structure	is	routinely	conflated	with	execution	strategy,	producing	persistent	confusion.

Existing	facilities	through	this	lens. Seen	through	this	model,	existing	facilities	differ	primarily	in expression ownership ,	not	in	parallelism:

- std::accumulate specifies	a	left-to-right	fold.	The	algorithm	fully	defines	the	abstract	expression,	yielding	a deterministic	result	for	a	given	input	order	and	operation.
- std::reduce explicitly	declines	to	specify	the	expression	structure.	It	defines	a generalized	sum ,	permitting reassociation	to	enable	scalable	execution.
- Execution	policies	operate	on	the	execution	dimension.	They	constrain	scheduling	and	concurrency,	but	do	not define	grouping/parenthesization	semantics	for	the	abstract	expression	being	evaluated.	Even execution::seq does	not	impose	a	specific	grouping	or	forbid	reassociation;	it	affects how an	algorithm	runs,	not what expression	it	computes.

This	explains	why std::reduce(execution::seq,	...) is	still	permitted	to	produce	different	results	for	nonassociative	operations:	the	algorithm	has	not	specified	the	expression,	and	the	policy	does	not	add	semantic guarantees.

Why	execution	policies	cannot	carry	expression	semantics. It	is	natural	to	ask	whether	a	canonical	reduction could	be	expressed	as	an	execution	policy	rather	than	a	new	algorithm.	Under	the	current	standard	model, execution	policies	are	deliberately	non-semantic	with	respect	to	the	returned	value:

1.  Policies	are	designed	to relax constraints	(permitting	concurrency,	vectorization),	not	to add new	semantic guarantees	about	grouping	or	parenthesization.
2.  Policies	are	composed	freely	and	orthogonally.	Encoding	topology	in	a	policy	would	require	dominance	rules	to resolve	conflicts	between	policies	that	specify	different	topologies	-	a	semantic	hierarchy	the	standard	does	not have.
3. std::reduce already	proves	the	limitation: std::reduce(execution::seq,	...) still	has	generalized-sum semantics.	If seq were	sufficient	to	fix	the	expression, std::reduce(seq,	...) would	collapse	into std::accumulate -	but	the	standard	explicitly	keeps	them	distinct.
4.  A	topology	parameter	is	a semantic parameter	that	intentionally	changes	observable	results	for	non-associative operations.	This	differs	in	kind	from	an	execution	hint.

Encoding	expression	structure	in	a	policy	would	therefore	require	a	fundamental	change	to	the	execution-policy model.	This	proposal	intentionally	avoids	that	scope.

Consequence. Because	expression	structure	is	a	semantic	concern	that	execution	policies	cannot	express,	and because	views	and	range	adaptors	can	reorder	traversal	but	cannot	constrain	combination	(§3.7),	expression ownership	must	reside	in	the	algorithm.	This	proposal	makes	the	abstract	expression	explicit	and	assigns	ownership of	it	to	the	algorithm,	restoring	a	clean	separation	between what is	computed	(expression), what is	guaranteed (algorithm),	and how it	is	executed	(execution	policy).

This	separation	also	clarifies	the	relationship	with	executors	(§3.10).

## 3.1	Why	Not	Left-Fold?

A	strict	left-to-right	fold	has	a	fixed	evaluation	order:

```
//	Left-fold T	result	=	init; for ( auto it	=	first;	it	!=	last;	++it) result	=	op(result,	*it);
```

This	is std::accumulate .	It	provides	run-to-run	stability	for	a	given	input	order,	but	it	cannot	parallelize	effectively because	each	operation	depends	on	the	prior	result.	The	reduction	depth	is	O(N)	rather	than	O(log	N),	making	it unsuitable	for	scalable	parallel	execution.

A	left-fold	therefore	solves	stability	but	not	scalability,	and	it	already	exists	in	the	standard	library.

## 3.2	Why	Not	Blocked	Decomposition?

A	common	parallelization	strategy	is	blocked	decomposition:	assign	contiguous	chunks	to	workers	and	reduce	each chunk:

```
//	Blocked	(illustrative) //	Thread	0:	E[0..N/4) //	Thread	1:	E[N/4..N/2) //	Thread	2:	E[N/2..3N/4) //	Thread	3:	E[3N/4..N)
```

Blocked	decomposition	can	be	efficient,	but	it	does	not	by	itself	provide	a	topology-stable	semantic	contract.	To obtain	a	fully	specified	abstract	expression,	the	standard	would	need	to	specify:

- the	exact	chunk	boundaries	(including	handling	of	non-power-of-two	sizes),
- how	chunk	results	are	combined	(the	second-stage	reduction	tree),	and
- how	these	choices	relate	to	the	execution	policy	and	degree	of	parallelism.

Absent	such	specification,	the	resulting	expression	is	naturally	coupled	to	execution	strategy	(thread	count, scheduler,	partitioner),	which	varies	across	implementations	and	runs.	Fully	specifying	these	details	effectively defines	a	new	algorithm	and	topology	-	at	which	point	the	question	becomes:	which	topology	should	be standardized?

This	proposal	selects	a	topology	that	is	simple	to	specify	canonically	and	maps	well	to	common	hardware	structures (see	§3.5).

## 3.3	Why	Not	a	Fixed	Standard	Constant?

Another	approach	is	to	standardize	a	fixed	topology	constant.	This	can	appear	attractive	for	simplicity	and uniformity,	but	it	ages	poorly:

- If	the	fixed	constant	is	too	small,	future	wider	hardware	may	be	underutilized.
- If	the	fixed	constant	is	too	large,	current	narrow	hardware	may	incur	unnecessary	work	or	overhead.
- Any	fixed	value	becomes	a	standard	revision	pressure	point	as	hardware	evolves.

A	fixed	constant	trades	long-term	efficiency	and	flexibility	for	initial	simplicity	and	becomes	an	ongoing	'default value'	debate.	This	proposal	instead	makes	topology	selection	an	explicit	part	of	the	semantic	contract	(§3.5).

## 3.4	Why	Not	Implementation-Defined?

Allowing	implementations	to	choose	the	reduction	topology	is	the	status	quo	problem.	For	parallel	reductions	such as std::reduce ,	the	Standard	permits	reassociation,	and	therefore	permits	different	abstract	expressions	across implementations	and	settings.

An	implementation-defined	topology	does	not	resolve	the	grouping	gap;	it	moves	the	source	of	variation	from	the algorithm's	reassociation	freedom	to	the	implementation's	topology	choice.	A	reproducibility	facility	must standardize	the	expression	structure	for	a	chosen	topology,	rather	than	leaving	that	structure	implementation defined.

## 3.5	The	proposed	design

The	facility	proposed	here	is	defined	by	a family	of	canonical	expressions parameterized	by	a	user-selected topology	coordinate.	For	a	chosen	coordinate,	the	Standard	defines	a	single	abstract	expression,	and	the	returned value	is	the	result	of	evaluating	that	expression	(as-if),	independent	of	execution	strategy.

Primary	topology	coordinate. The	expression	is	defined	in	terms	of	the lane	count L .	For	intuition: L	=	1 degenerates	to	a	single	tree	over	the	input	sequence	(no	lane	interleaving).	Larger L introduces	SIMD/GPU-friendly lane	parallelism	but	still	denotes	one	Standard-defined	expression	fully	determined	by (N,	L) .	The	normative definition	of	the	two-stage	reduction	(lane	partitioning,	per-lane	tree,	cross-lane	tree)	appears	in	§4.

Why	interleaved	lanes,	not	contiguous	blocks? A	contiguous-block	partition	(elements [0,	N/L) to	lane	0, [N/L, 2N/L) to	lane	1,	etc.)	would	also	be	topology-stable.	The	interleaved	layout	is	chosen	because	it	maps	directly	to SIMD	register	filling:	a	single	aligned	vector	load	of L consecutive	elements	places	one	element	into	each	lane simultaneously.	Contiguous	blocks	would	require	gathering	from L distant	memory	locations	to	fill	a	register. Additionally,	interleaving	guarantees	that	all	lanes	have	the	same	number	of	elements	(to	within	one),	so	all	lanes execute	the	same	tree	shape	-	enabling	SIMD	lockstep	execution	without	per-lane	branching.	This	uniform	tree shape	across	lanes	is	what	makes	the	two-stage	decomposition	(§4.4)	efficient	in	practice.

The	lane	count L is	the	sole	topology	coordinate	that	defines	the	semantics.	Earlier	explorations	considered	a	bytespan	parameter M (where L	=	M	/	sizeof(value\_type) ),	but	this	creates	a	portability	trap: sizeof(value\_type) varies	across	platforms,	so	the	same M value	silently	produces	different	expressions	on	different	targets.	§9.2 discusses	this	rationale	in	detail.

## 3.6	Industry	precedents	for	constrained	computation	structure

A	common	counter-argument	is	that	because	bitwise	identity	across	different	ISAs	(e.g.,	x86	vs.	ARM)	cannot	be guaranteed	by	the	C++	Standard	alone,	the	library	should	not	attempt	to	provide	run-to-run	stability	guarantees. However,	existing	industry	practice	demonstrates	the	value	of	partial	guarantees	-	specifically,	fixing	the computation	topology	-	even	when	full	bitwise	identity	is	not	achievable.

A	widely	used	mechanism	for	improving	reproducibility	is	to constrain	computation	structure (topology,	kernel choice,	or	execution	path)	to	remove	sources	of	run-to-run	variability	introduced	by	parallel	execution.	This	proposal targets	one	such	source:	unspecified	reassociation	inside	standard	parallel	reductions.	Fixing	the	abstract expression	is	therefore	an	important	building	block	for	reproducible	parallel	reductions;	additional	conditions	(e.g., floating-point	evaluation	model	and	environment	constraints)	remain	outside	the	scope	of	this	paper.

## 3.6.2	References	(informative)

Intel	oneMKL	CNR: Intel	documents	that	parallel	algorithms	can	produce	different	results	based	on	thread	counts and	ISA	and	provides	CNR	modes	to	constrain	execution	paths.	See:	Intel	oneMKL	Developer	Guide,	'Getting Started	with	Conditional	Numerical	Reproducibility'	[IntelCNR].

NVIDIA	CUB	/	Thrust	(CUDA	ecosystem): NVIDIA's	CUDA	reduction	libraries	include	documented	techniques and	configuration	choices	intended	to	improve	determinism	and	reproducibility	of	reductions	(typically	by	avoiding schedule-dependent	combination	mechanisms	and	by	selecting	reduction	strategies	with	a	more	stable, implementation-defined	combination	order).	The	scope	of	these	guarantees	is	library-	and	version-dependent	and	is not	standardized	across	platforms.	See:	NVIDIA	CUB	documentation	[NvidiaCUB].

This	proposal	does	not	standardize	vendor-specific	reproducibility	modes;	it	standardizes	a	portable	semantic building	block:	a	fixed	abstract	reduction	expression.

These	libraries	address	reproducibility	through	different	mechanisms	and	with	different	scope.	This	proposal	does not	claim	to	replicate	their	exact	guarantees	but	draws	on	the	same	insight:	fixing	the	computation	structure	is	a useful	building	block	for	reproducibility.

The	heterogeneous	convergence	argument: Each	vendor	-	Intel	(CNR),	NVIDIA	(CUDA	reduction	libraries), and	framework	authors	(PyTorch,	Kokkos)	-	has	independently	built	a	proprietary	determinism	facility	because	the C++	Standard	provides	no	canonical	expression	to	target.	As	P2300	senders/receivers	enable	heterogeneous dispatch	across	CPUs,	GPUs,	and	accelerators,	this	fragmentation	worsens:	a	developer	seeking	deterministic reduction	must	use	vendor-specific	APIs	on	each	target.	A	standard-defined	canonical	compute	sequence	provides the common	mathematical	contract that	all	implementations	-	regardless	of	execution	substrate	-	can converge	on.	The	standard	defines what	expression is	computed;	vendors	retain	full	freedom	in how to	evaluate	it	on their	hardware.

## 3.6.3	Conclusion

By	fixing	the	abstract	expression	structure,	this	proposal	provides	an important	building	block for	reproducibility -	but	not	a	sufficient	one.	Sufficient	conditions	depend	on	the	program's	floating-point	evaluation	model	and environment	(§6).

## 3.7	The	structural	necessity	of	a	new	algorithm

A	central	tenet	of	this	proposal	is	that	run-to-run	stability	of	the	returned	value	is	a property	of	the	evaluation , not	the	data	source.	To	achieve	both	logarithmic	scalability	and	topological	determinism,	the	algorithm	itself	must 'own'	the	reduction	tree.	This	logic	cannot	be	injected	into	existing	algorithms	via	a	View	or	a	Range	adaptor.

## 3.7.1	Why	std::reduce	+	Views	cannot	provide	this	contract

A	range	adaptor	(View)	can	change	which	values	are	presented	to	an	algorithm	and	in	what	iteration	order	they	are produced.	However,	a	view	does	not	and	cannot	constrain	the	combination	semantics	of	the	consuming	algorithm.

std::reduce is	specified	in	terms	of GENERALIZED\_SUM ,	which	intentionally	permits	the	implementation	to	reassociate the	expression	and	(under GENERALIZED\_SUM )	to	reorder	operands.	Consequently,	even	if	a	view	presents	a deterministic	sequence,	a	call	to std::reduce may	still	evaluate	a	different	abstract	expression	than	any	fixed

parenthesization	intended	by	the	adaptor.

Therefore,	a	'deterministic	reduction'	contract	cannot	be	obtained	by	composing	views	with std::reduce :	it requires	an	algorithm	whose	specification	owns	the	reduction	expression	and	defines	the	returned	value	as-if evaluating	that	expression.

```
//	A	deterministic	view	does	not	make	std::reduce	deterministic: auto view	=	data	|	views::transform(f); //	preserves	iteration	order auto r1	=	std::reduce(std::execution::par,	view.begin(),	view.end(),	init,	op); //	r1	may	still	use	an	implementation-chosen	reassociation.
```

## 3.7.2	Consequence:	the	algorithm	must	own	the	expression

To	provide	the	guarantee	defined	in	§4,	the	reduction	facility	itself	must	specify	and	'own'	the	abstract	expression tree.	As	established	in	§3.0,	expression	structure	cannot	reside	in	execution	policies,	views,	or	executors	-	the algorithm	is	the	only	standard	mechanism	that	can	own	expression	semantics.

## 3.8	Rationale	for	tree	shape	choice

Given	that	a	new	algorithm	must	own	its	expression	tree	(§3.7.2),	the	next	design	question	is:	which	tree construction	rule	should	the	Standard	specify?	Two	well-known	candidates	exist:	iterative	pairwise	(shift-reduce) and	recursive	bisection.	This	subsection	records	the	considerations	that	inform	the	choice.

The	discussion	in	this	subsection	concerns	implementation	strategies	only	and	does	not	alter	the	semantic requirement	that	the	returned	value	be	that	of	the	canonical	expression	defined	in	§4	for	the	completed	input sequence	of	length N .	The	specification	in	§4-§5	does	not	require	incremental	evaluation,	streaming,	or	any particular	execution	strategy.

## 3.8.1	Candidate	comparison

## Arguments	favoring	iterative	pairwise	(recommended):

1. Industry	alignment: SIMD	and	GPU	implementations	commonly	use	iterative	pairwise	because	it	maps	directly to	hardware	primitives	(warp	shuffle-down,	vector	lane	pairing).	This	includes	NVIDIA	CUB's	deterministic reduction	modes.
2. Implementation	naturalness: For	implementers	familiar	with	GPU	and	SIMD	programming,	iterative	pairwise matches	the	mental	model	of	'pair	adjacent	lanes,	carry	the	odd	one'	-	the	same	pattern	used	in	existing	highperformance	reduction	kernels.
3. Adoption	ease: Libraries	that	already	implement	deterministic	reductions	using	iterative	pairwise	would require	no	algorithmic	changes	to	conform	to	this	specification.	This	lowers	the	barrier	to	adoption.
4. Direct	SIMD	mapping: The	iterative	pairwise	pattern	corresponds	directly	to	shuffle-down	operations	on	GPU warps	and	SIMD	vector	lanes,	enabling	efficient	implementation	without	index	remapping.

## Arguments	favoring	recursive	bisection:

1. Specification	clarity: The	recursive	definition	is	three	lines	with	no	special	cases.	The	iterative	definition requires	explicit	handling	of	odd	count	carry	logic.
2. Tree	symmetry: For	non-power-of-two	k,	recursive	bisection	produces	more	balanced	subtrees.	The	'heavier' subtree	(with	more	elements)	is	always	on	the	right,	following	the m	=	floor(k/2) split.
3. Academic	precedent: Recursive	bisection	corresponds	to	the	'pairwise	summation'	algorithm	analyzed	in numerical	analysis	literature	([Higham2002]	§4).

## Why	the	choice	matters:

For	non-associative	operations	(e.g.,	floating-point	addition),	the	two	algorithms	produce	different	numerical	results for	non-power-of-two	k.	Once	standardized,	the	choice	cannot	be	changed	without	breaking	existing	code	that depends	on	specific	results.

## Why	the	choice	is	bounded:

Both	algorithms	have	comparable	pairwise-summation	error	bounds	(see	[Higham2002]).	Both	produce	identical trees	for	power-of-two	k.	The	practical	impact	is	limited	to:	-	Non-power-of-two	per-lane	element	counts	(when ceil(N/L) is	not	a	power	of	two)	-	Non-power-of-two	lane	counts	(when	L	itself	is	not	a	power	of	two)	-	Cross-lane reduction	when	N	does	not	evenly	divide	L

For	the	common	case	of	power-of-two	L	and	large	N,	the	per-lane	trees	are	dominated	by	power-of-two	cases	where both	algorithms	agree.

Visual	comparison	(k	=	7): For	power-of-two	k,	both	algorithms	produce	identical	trees.	The	difference	is	visible only	for	non-power-of-two	k.	The	following	side-by-side	comparison	for	k	=	7	illustrates	the	full	extent	of	the difference:

IPR: ((e₀⊕e₁)⊕(e₂⊕e₃))⊕((e₄⊕e₅)⊕e₆) ·	RB: (e₀⊕(e₁⊕e₂))⊕((e₃⊕e₄)⊕(e₅⊕e₆))

<!-- image -->

Both	trees	have	depth	3	(=	⌈log₂	7⌉).	Both	perform	exactly	6	applications	of binary\_op .	The	error	bounds	are comparable	(see	[Higham2002]).	The	only	difference	is	which	element	carries:	IPR	carries e₆ (the	last	element, locally	determined),	while	recursive	bisection	splits	at floor(7/2)	=	3 ,	changing	the	pairing	of e₀ (a	globally determined	property	-	the	pairing	of	the	first	element	depends	on	the	total	count).

This	paper	specifies	iterative	pairwise because	it	aligns	with	existing	practice	in	high-performance	libraries	that already	provide	deterministic	reduction	modes.	This	minimizes	disruption	for	implementers	and	users	who	have existing	workflows	built	around	these	libraries.

Throughput	considerations	and	regret	analysis	for	this	choice	are	discussed	in	Appendix	P .

## 3.8.2	Streaming	evaluation

Motivation	only: nothing	in	§4-§5	requires	streaming	or	incremental	composition;	this	subsection	discusses implementation	alignment.

The	fundamental	structural	difference. The	most	significant	distinction	between	the	two	candidates	is	not performance	or	symmetry	-	it	is	that	iterative	pairwise	is	an online algorithm	and	recursive	bisection	is	a batch algorithm.

Recursive	bisection's	first	operation	is	to	compute	a	midpoint: mid	=	N/2 .	The	entire	split	tree	is	determined	topdown	from	the	global	sequence	length.	Evaluation	cannot	begin	until	N	is	known,	and	the	split	structure	depends	on the	global	property	of	the	input.

Iterative	pairwise	(shift-reduce)	processes	elements	incrementally:	each	element	is	shifted	onto	an	O(log	N)	stack, and	reductions	are	triggered	by	a	branchless	bit-test	on	the	running	count	( ntz(count) ).	The	stack	captures	the complete	computation	state	at	any	point.	N	is	not	needed	until	termination,	when	remaining	stack	entries	are collapsed.

This	structural	property	has	concrete	consequences	for	how	C++	is	evolving:

1. Forward	ranges	without size() : IPR	can	begin	reducing	immediately	with	a	single	forward	pass.	Recursive bisection	requires	either	a	counting	pass	or	random	access	to	compute	split	points.
2. Chunked	executor	evaluation: An	executor	delivering	data	in	chunks	can	feed	each	chunk	into	the	shift-reduce loop.	The	stack	state	is	the	continuation	-	evaluation	can	pause	and	resume	at	any	chunk	boundary.	Recursive bisection	requires	the	global	N	before	reduction	can	begin,	forcing	a	synchronization	barrier.
3. P2300	sender/receiver	composition: P2300	( std::execution ,	adopted	for	C++26)	explicitly	separates what to execute	from where to	execute	it,	and	senders	describe	composable	units	of	asynchronous	work.	A	streaming reduction	using	IPR	is	naturally	expressible	as	a	sender	that	consumes	elements	as	they	flow	through	a	pipeline. Recursive	bisection	requires	knowing	the	complete	input	before	constructing	the	expression	-	it	does	not naturally	compose	incrementally	without	materializing	(or	at	least	sizing)	the	range.
4. Heterogeneous	and	distributed	execution: Data	arriving	asynchronously	from	GPU	kernels,	network reduction,	or	distributed	aggregation	can	be	consumed	incrementally	by	IPR.	Recursive	bisection	must	buffer	the complete	sequence	before	computation	begins.

In	a	standard	moving	toward	sender/receiver	pipelines	and	composable	asynchronous	execution,	the	tree	shape	that can	be	evaluated	without	materializing	the	entire	sequence	is	the	one	structurally	aligned	with	the	future	of	C++ execution.	This	is	an	architectural	property	that	determines	whether	the	canonical	expression	can	participate	in streaming	pipelines;	the	returned	value	is	nonetheless	defined	with	respect	to	the	final	N.

[ Note: The	current	normative	definition	(§4)	is	stated	in	terms	of K	=	ceil(N/L) ,	so	the	specification	as	written requires	a	well-defined	N	(§2.2).	However,	the	streaming	property	is	inherent	to	the	iterative	pairwise	algorithm: lane	assignment	( i	mod	L )	is	known	per-element,	and	the	shift-reduce	procedure	within	each	lane	builds	the	tree incrementally	without	foreknowledge	of	the	lane's	element	count.	N	is	needed	only	to	determine	when	to	stop	and collapse	remaining	stack	entries.	Future	API	revisions	may	exploit	this	property	to	weaken	iterator	and	sizing requirements. -end	note ]

Lane-locality	of	streaming	evaluation. Because	lane	assignment	is	determined	solely	by	the	input	index	( i	mod L ),	each	element	belongs	to	exactly	one	lane,	and	the	shift-reduce	stack	maintained	for	that	lane	captures	the complete	canonical	subtree	for	all	elements	of	that	lane	observed	so	far.	Streaming	evaluation	therefore	preserves the	expression:	inter-lane	ordering	is	determined	only	by	Stage	2	(§4.4),	which	is	itself	evaluated	by	the	same	tree rule	after	all	per-lane	reductions	complete.	Chunked	or	incremental	delivery	of	elements	does	not	alter	the	abstract expression,	provided	that	elements	are	presented	in	increasing	input	index	order.

These	observations	describe	implementation	properties	of	the	iterative	pairwise	formulation.	They	do	not	impose added	semantic	requirements	beyond	those	stated	in	§4-§5.

## 3.9	Deferral	of	API	surface

This	paper	acknowledges	the	importance	of	a	Ranges-first	model	in	modern	C++,	but	the	specific	API	surface	(new algorithm,	new	execution	policy,	or	range-based	overload)	is	deliberately	deferred	to	a	later	revision.	Expression structure	is	orthogonal	to	API	surface;	fixing	it	first	allows	API	alternatives	to	be	evaluated	against	a	stable	semantic baseline.	Once	LEWG	reaches	consensus	on	this	semantic	foundation,	a	follow-on	revision	can	propose	an	API	that aligns	with	modern	library	patterns.

## 3.10	Relationship	to	Executors

The	expression/algorithm/execution	separation	described	in	§3.0	aligns	naturally	with	the	sender/receiver	execution model	adopted	for	C++26	(P2300).

P2300	( std::execution )	addresses	the	execution	concern: where work	runs, when it	runs, how it	is	scheduled,	and what	progress	guarantees	apply.	Its	stated	design	principle	-	'address	the	concern	of what to	execute	separately from	the	concern	of where '	-	is	the	same	separation	this	proposal	formalizes	for	reduction	expressions.	In	the absence	of	a	specified	expression,	different	schedulers	may	legitimately	induce	different	groupings	for	a	reduction, leading	to	scheduler-dependent	results.

By	fixing	the	abstract	expression	in	the	algorithm,	this	proposal	provides	executors	with	a	stable	semantic	target:

- The algorithm defines what computation	must	be	performed.
- The executor determines how that	computation	is	evaluated.

Different	schedulers	-	CPU	thread	pool,	GPU	stream,	or	distributed	sender	chain	-	may	execute	the	expression using	different	physical	strategies,	but	they	must	produce	the	same	returned	value	for	a	fixed	expression	and floating-point	evaluation	model.

In	this	sense,	the	proposal	is	orthogonal	and	complementary	to	P2300.	It	does	not	constrain	execution;	it	enables consistency	across	schedulers	when	the	same	canonical	expression	(fixed L )	and	floating-point	evaluation	model	are used.	The	streaming	property	of	iterative	pairwise	(§3.8)	is	particularly	relevant	here:	the	canonical	expression	can be	evaluated	incrementally	as	data	flows	through	a	sender	pipeline,	without	requiring	materialization	of	the	entire sequence	prior	to	evaluation;	the	returned	value	is	defined	with	respect	to	the	final	sequence	length	N.

## 4.	Fixed	Expression	Structure	(Canonical	Reduction	Expression) [canonical.reduce]

Normative. Sections	§4-§5	specify	the	semantic	contract	of	this	proposal.	All	other	sections	are	informative.

Mandates: L	>=	1 .

Summary. For	input	sequence X[0..N) ,	binary	operation op ,	and	lane	count L :

1. Partition X into L interleaved	lanes	by i	mod	L .	Element X[i] is	assigned	to	lane i	mod	L ,	preserving	input	order within	each	lane.
2. Stage	1	-	Per-lane	reduction. For	each	lane j in [0,	L) ,	evaluate CANONICAL\_TREE\_EVAL(op,	Y\_j) where Y\_j has K	=	ceil(N/L) positions.	Absent	trailing	positions	(when N is	not	a	multiple	of L )	propagate	without	invoking op .
3. Stage	2	-	Cross-lane	reduction. Reduce	the L lane	results R[0..L) using CANONICAL\_TREE\_EVAL(op,	R[0..L)) .
4. Init	integration. If init is	provided	and N	==	0 ,	return A{init} .	If init is	provided	and N	>	0 ,	let I be A{init} and	let R be	the	value	extracted	from R\_all ;	return op(I,	R) .	Otherwise	(no init , N	>	0 ),	return	the	value extracted	from R\_all .

CANONICAL\_TREE\_EVAL is	an	iterative	pairwise	(shift-reduce)	tree:	pair	adjacent	elements	left-to-right,	carry	any	odd trailing	element,	repeat.	The	tree	shape	is	fully	determined	by	the	element	count.	Only	the	abstract	expression structure	is	specified.	When	evaluated	with	an	execution	policy,	independent	subexpressions	may	be	evaluated concurrently	or	vectorized,	provided	the	returned	value	matches	that	of	the	canonical	expression.	The	remainder	of §4	defines	each	component	precisely.

[ Note: The	semantic	contract	in	§4	is	defined	in	terms	of	the	returned	value.	The	invocation	count	is	specified (§4.2.2). -end	note ]

Sequencing	of binary\_op evaluations. For	all	overloads,	the	returned	value	shall	be	as	if	obtained	by	evaluating the	canonical	expression	defined	in	§4.

Without	an	execution	policy,	the	returned	value	is	defined	as-if	evaluating	the	canonical	reduction	expression specified	in	this	section.	With	an	execution	policy,	the	relative	order	of	evaluations	of binary\_op -	and	thus	the relative	order	of	any	side	effects	-	is	unspecified;	evaluations	may	be	unsequenced	or	concurrent,	as	permitted	by [algorithms.parallel.exec] ,	provided	the	returned	value	matches	that	of	the	canonical	expression.	In	both	cases, the	relative	order	of	side	effects	of binary\_op is	unspecified	(see	§5,	Scope	of	guarantee).

Non-commutative	operations. The	canonical	expression	fixes	the	left	and	right	operand	at	every op(a,	b) node	in the	tree.	For	non-commutative binary\_op ,	the	operand	order	is	fully	determined	by	the	tree	structure	defined	in §4.2-§4.4;	scheduling	may	vary	(under	an	execution	policy)	but	must	produce	the	same	returned	value	as	evaluating the	operand-ordered	tree.	Init	placement	(§4.5)	is	likewise	fixed: op(init,	R\_all) ,	with init as	the	left	operand.

## Overview:	Two-stage	reduction

The	reduction	proceeds	in	two	stages	over	an	interleaved	lane	partition.	The	input	sequence	of N elements	is distributed	across L lanes	by	index	modulo	(element i →	lane i	mod	L ).	In	Stage	1,	each	lane	independently	reduces its	elements	using	the	canonical	tree	shape.	In	Stage	2,	the L lane	results	are	themselves	reduced	using	the	same tree	rule.	Both	stages	use CANONICAL\_TREE\_EVAL (§4.2.3),	ensuring	a	fully	determined	expression	from	input	to	result.

<!-- image -->

The	lane	count L is	the	single	topology	parameter	that	determines	the	shape	of	the	entire	computation.	When L	=	1 , the	two-stage	structure	collapses	to	a	single	canonical	tree	over	the	entire	input	sequence	(one	lane,	no	cross-lane reduction).	Sections	§4.1-§4.4	define	each	component	precisely;	§4.3.4	addresses	ragged	tails	when N is	not	a multiple	of L .

[ Note: L	=	1 denotes	a	single	canonical	tree	over	the	full	input,	not std::accumulate 's	left-fold;	for	non-associative operations	these	expressions	yield	different	results. -end	note ]

This	specification	defines	the	canonical	expression	structure	only;	it	does	not	prescribe	an	evaluation	strategy. However,	the	iterative	pairwise	formulation	can	be	evaluated	efficiently	across	threads	while	preserving	the	tree. When	each	thread	processes	a	power-of-two-sized	chunk	of	the	input,	the	shift-reduce	process	within	that	chunk collapses	to	a	single	completed	subtree	-	the	smallest	possible	merge	state.	Adjacent	chunk	results	can	then	be combined	in	index	order,	recovering	the	expression	regardless	of	thread	count.	A	detailed	parallel	realization strategy	is	described	in	Appendix	N.

Why L is	a	semantic	parameter,	not	a	hardware	hint. For	non-associative binary\_op (notably	floating-point addition),	different	reduction	topologies	produce	different	results	-	this	is	precisely	why std::reduce leaves	its expression	unspecified.	To specify the	expression,	a	topology	must	be	selected. L is	that	selection:	it	determines	the lane	interleaving	and	canonical	tree	structure,	fixing	a	single	abstract	expression.	Changing L intentionally	changes the	expression	and	may	change	the	result	-	just	as std::accumulate 's	left-fold	produces	a	different	result	from	a tree	reduction. L is	not	a	performance	hint;	it	is	the	coordinate	that	makes	the	expression	unique.	Safe	defaults	and named	presets	are	API	concerns	deferred	to	a	future	revision	(see	§9.2,	§9.6).

## 4.1	Canonical	tree	shape	[canonical.reduce.tree]

To	mirror	the	style	used	in	the	Numerics	clauses	(e.g. GENERALIZED\_SUM ),	this	paper	introduces	definitional	functions used	solely	to	specify	required	parenthesization	and	left/right	operand	order.	These	functions	do	not	propose Standard	Library	names.

For	a	fixed	input	order,	lane	count L ,	and binary\_op ,	the	abstract	expression	(parenthesization	and	left/right	operand order)	is	uniquely	determined	by:

1. Interleaved	lanes :	for	a	lane	count L ,	the	input	positions	are	partitioned	into L logical	subsequences	(lanes) based	on i	%	L ,	preserving	input	order	within	each	lane	(§4.3),	followed	by	a	second	canonical	reduction	over lane	results	(§4.4).
2. A	canonical	iterative	pairwise	tree defined	by	a	standard-fixed	algorithm	(§4.2.3).

[ Note: The	iterative	pairwise-with-carry	tree	structure	used	by	this	paper	corresponds	to	the	well-known shiftreduce (carry-chain	/	binary-counter	stack)	formulation	of	pairwise	summation	described	by	Dalton,	Wang,	and Blainey	[Dalton2014]. -end	note ]

This	canonical	tree	is	near-balanced:	it	is	exactly	balanced	when	the	number	of	participating	operands	is	a	power	of two;	otherwise	it	corresponds	to	iterative	pairwise	reduction	with	carry/absent	operands	as	specified	in	§4.

A	near-balanced	tree	over	a	non-power-of-two	number	of	leaves	implicitly	contains	operand	positions	for	which	no input	element	is	present.	This	paper	makes	that absence explicit	in	the	semantic	model:	when	the	tree	geometry requires	combining	two	operands	but	one	operand	is	absent, binary\_op is	not	applied	and	the	present	operand	is propagated	unchanged	(§4.2.2).	This	avoids	padding	values	and	imposes	no	identity-element	requirements	on binary\_op .

## 4.2	Canonical	tree	reduction	with	absent	operands	[canonical.reduce.tree.absent]

## 4.2.1	Canonical	split	rule	(pairing	count	per	round)	[canonical.reduce.tree.split]

Given	a	working	sequence	of	length n ,	define	the	number	of	pairs	formed	in	each	round:

- let h	=	floor(n	/	2) .

The	split	rule h	=	floor(n	/	2) is	normative	and	governs	the	number	of	pairs	formed	in	each	round	of	the	iterative pairwise	algorithm	(§4.2.3).	It	does	not	by	itself	determine	the	tree	shape;	the	complete	tree	is	determined	by	the iterative	pairing	and	carry	logic	defined	in	§4.2.3.

## 4.2.2	Lifted	combine	on	absent	operands	[canonical.reduce.tree.combine]

Let maybe<A> be	a	conceptual	domain	with	values	either present(a) (for a of	type A )	or ∅ ('absent').	The maybe<A> and ∅ notation	are	purely	definitional	devices	used	to	specify	the	handling	of	non-power-of-two	inputs	without requiring	an	identity	element;	they	do	not	appear	in	any	proposed	interface	and	implementations	need	not	model absence	explicitly.

Define	the	lifted	operation COMBINE(op,	u,	v) on maybe<A> :

```
COMBINE(op,	∅,	x)	=	x COMBINE(op,	x,	∅)	=	x COMBINE(op,	∅,	∅)	=	∅ COMBINE(op,	present(x),	present(y))	=	present(	static_cast<A>(	op(x,	y)	)	)
```

[ Note: In	implementation	terms, COMBINE is	the	familiar	SIMD	tail-masking	or	epilogue	pattern:	when	an	input sequence	does	not	fill	the	last	group	evenly,	the	implementation	skips	the	missing	positions	rather	than	fabricating values.	The	formalism	above	specifies	this	behavior	precisely	without	prescribing	the	implementation	technique (predicated	lanes,	scalar	epilogue,	masked	operations,	etc.). -end	note ]

This	lifted	operation	does	not	require binary\_op to	have	an	identity	element.	Absence	is	a	property	of	the	expression geometry	(whether	an	operator	application	exists),	not	a	property	of binary\_op .

The	use	of ∅ is	a	definitional	device.	For	any	given (N,	L) ,	the	locations	of	absent	leaves	are	fully	determined	(they occur	only	in	the	ragged	tail,	§4.3.4).	Implementations	can	therefore	handle	the	tail	using	an	epilogue	or	masking, without	introducing	per-node	conditionals	in	the	main	reduction.

[ Note: The maybe<A> formalism	is	a	specification	device	analogous	to std::optional<A> ;	it	is	not	a	proposed	API	type and	implementations	need	not	materialize	optional	objects. -end	note ]

Implementations	need	not	lift binary\_op into	an	optional	domain.	A	common	strategy	is	to	apply	the	canonical	tree rule	over	full	SIMD	groups	and	evaluate	any	ragged	tail	using	a	scalar	iterative	pairwise	loop.	This	naturally satisfies	the	invocation	constraint	without	introducing	additional	branches	into	the	vectorized	reduction.

Invocation	constraint. A	conforming	implementation	shall	evaluate binary\_op only	at	internal	nodes	of	the canonical	tree	where	both	child	subexpressions	are	present	(the	fourth	case	of COMBINE above).	Propagation	through an	absent	operand	(the	first	three	cases)	does	not	evaluate binary\_op .	For	any	input	sequence	of	length N	>	0 ,	the canonical	expression	contains	exactly N	-	1 evaluations	of binary\_op .	When	an	initial	value init is	provided	and N	> 0 ,	one	additional	evaluation	is	performed	(§4.5),	for	a	total	of N .	This	requirement	applies	only	to	evaluations	that complete	normally.	If	evaluation	exits	via	an	exception	or	calls std::terminate under	a	policy-based	execution	mode, no	invocation-count	guarantee	is	made.

[ Note: An	implementation	that	pads	absent	positions	with	a	value	(e.g.,	an	identity	element)	and	applies binary\_op to	the	padded	operands	would	produce	the	same	returned	value	for binary\_op operations	that	possess	an	identity but	would	invoke binary\_op more	times	than	specified.	Such	an	implementation	does	not	conform	to	this specification,	because	it	violates	the	invocation	count	and	may	produce	observable	differences	for	stateful binary\_op . -end	note ]

[ Note: Internal	implementation	mechanisms	that	do	not	evaluate	the	user-supplied binary\_op -	such	as	predicated SIMD	lanes,	masked	vector	operations,	or	compiler-generated	code	operating	on	implementation-internal	state	are	not	constrained	by	the	invocation	count	above.	The	constraint	applies	solely	to	evaluations	of	the	user-supplied callable. -end	note ]

## 4.2.3	Canonical	tree	evaluation:	Iterative	Pairwise	[canonical.reduce.tree.eval]

This	subsection	defines	the	canonical	tree-building	algorithm	using	iterative	pairwise	reduction.	The	algorithm	pairs adjacent	elements	left-to-right	in	each	round,	carrying	the	odd	trailing	element	to	the	next	round.	This	corresponds to	the	shift-reduce	summation	pattern	described	by	Dalton,	Wang,	and	Blainey	[Dalton2014]	and	matches	the shuffle-down	pattern	used	in	CUDA	CUB	and	GPU	warp	reductions	(see	§3.8	for	rationale).

Define CANONICAL\_TREE\_EVAL(op,	Y[0..k)) ,	where k	>=	1 and	each Y[t] is	in maybe<A> :

```
CANONICAL_TREE_EVAL(op,	Y[0..k)): if	k	==	1: return	Y[0] //	Iteratively	pair	adjacent	elements	until	one	remains let	W	=	Y[0..k)		//	working	sequence	(conceptual	copy) while	|W|	>	1: let	n	=	|W| let	h	=	floor(n	/	2) //	Pair	elements:	W'[i]	=	COMBINE(op,	W[2i],	W[2i+1])	for	i	in	[0,	h) let	W'	=	[	COMBINE(op,	W[2*i],	W[2*i	+	1])	for	i	in	[0,	h)	] //	If	n	is	odd,	carry	the	last	element if	n	is	odd: W'	=	W'	++	[	W[n-1]	] W	=	W' return	W[0]
```

When CANONICAL\_TREE\_EVAL returns ∅ ,	it	denotes	that	no	present	operands	existed	in	the	evaluated	subtree.

## Shift-reduce	state	table	(k	=	8):

The	following	table	illustrates	the	iterative	pairwise	algorithm	step	by	step	for k	=	8 elements,	adapted	from [Dalton2014]	Figure	4.	Each	step	either shifts (pushes	an	element	onto	the	stack)	or reduces (combines	the	top	two stack	entries	of	the	same	tree	level).	Lowercase	letters	denote	intermediate	results	at	successively	higher	levels	of the	tree: a terms	are	sums	of	two	elements, b terms	are	sums	of	two a terms,	and	so	on.

```
Sequence																				Stack																	Operation ───────────────────────────	─────────────────────	──────────────────── e₀	e₁	e₂	e₃	e₄	e₅	e₆	e₇			∅																					shift	e₀ e₁	e₂	e₃	e₄	e₅	e₆	e₇						e₀																				shift	e₁ e₂	e₃	e₄	e₅	e₆	e₇									e₀	e₁																	reduce	a₀	=	op(e₀,	e₁) e₂	e₃	e₄	e₅	e₆	e₇									a₀																				shift	e₂ e₃	e₄	e₅	e₆	e₇												a₀	e₂																	shift	e₃ e₄	e₅	e₆	e₇															a₀	e₂	e₃														reduce	a₁	=	op(e₂,	e₃) e₄	e₅	e₆	e₇															a₀	a₁																	reduce	b₀	=	op(a₀,	a₁) e₄	e₅	e₆	e₇															b₀																				shift	e₄ e₅	e₆	e₇																		b₀	e₄																	shift	e₅ e₆	e₇																					b₀	e₄	e₅														reduce	a₂	=	op(e₄,	e₅) e₆	e₇																					b₀	a₂																	shift	e₆ e₇																									b₀	a₂	e₆														shift	e₇ ∅																										b₀	a₂	e₆	e₇											reduce	a₃	=	op(e₆,	e₇) ∅																										b₀	a₂	a₃														reduce	b₁	=	op(a₂,	a₃) ∅																										b₀	b₁																	reduce	c₀	=	op(b₀,	b₁) ∅																										c₀																				done
```

The	final	result c₀ is	the	value	of	the	canonical	expression.	The	number	of	reductions	after	the n -th	shift	is determined	by	the	number	of	trailing	zeros	in	the	binary	representation	of n [Dalton2014].

## Tree	diagram	(k	=	8):

The	state	table	above	produces	the	following	canonical	expression	tree	-	a	perfectly	balanced	binary	tree	for power-of-two k :

```
op	(c₀) /								\ op	(b₀)										op	(b₁) /					\										/					\ op	(a₀)	op	(a₁)		op	(a₂)	op	(a₃) /	\					/	\							/	\					/	\ e₀	e₁		e₂	e₃				e₄	e₅		e₆	e₇
```

Expression: ((e₀	⊕	e₁)	⊕	(e₂	⊕	e₃))	⊕	((e₄	⊕	e₅)	⊕	(e₆	⊕	e₇))

## Tree	diagram	(k	=	7,	non-power-of-two):

When k is	not	a	power	of	two,	the	odd	trailing	element	is	carried	forward,	producing	a	slightly	unbalanced	tree.	This is	where	the	carry	logic	in	the	algorithm	definition	above	determines	the	canonical	shape:

<!-- image -->

```
op /				\ op						op /		\				/		\ op			op		op		e₆ /	\		/	\		/	\ e₀	e₁	e₂	e₃	e₄	e₅
```

Expression: ((e₀	⊕	e₁)	⊕	(e₂	⊕	e₃))	⊕	((e₄	⊕	e₅)	⊕	e₆)

The	left	subtree	is	identical	to	the k	=	8 case	with	the	last	element	removed.	The	carry	of e₆ at	round	1	(odd n	=	7 ) places	it	as	the	right	child	of	the	right	subtree's	right	branch.

## 4.2.4	Canonical	tree	diagrams	(informative)

The	following	diagrams	illustrate	the	fixed	abstract	expression	structure	only;	they	do	not	imply	any	particular evaluation	order,	scheduling,	or	implementation	strategy.

```
Legend	(informative) present(x)		:	a	present	operand	holding	value	x	(type	A) ∅											:	an	absent	operand	position	(no	input	element	exists	there) combine(u,v)	:	lifted	combine: -	combine(∅,	x)	=	x -	combine(x,	∅)	=	x -	combine(∅,	∅)	=	∅ -	combine(x,	y)	=	op(x,	y)	when	both	present op(a,b)					:	the	user-supplied	binary_op,	applied	only	when	both	operands	exist
```

Example:	absence	propagation	with	k	=	5,	Y	=	[	X0,	X1,	X2, ∅ , ∅ ]

```
COMBINE										→	propagates	left	child	(right	is	∅) /							\ COMBINE						∅							carried	from	round	2	(odd	n=3) /				\ COMBINE		COMBINE									→	left:	evaluates	op(X0,	X1);	right:	propagates	X2 /	\					/	\ X0		X1		X2		∅
```

Result: op(op(X0,	X1),	X2) -	two	evaluations	of binary\_op (both	children	present	at	two	nodes)	from	three	present elements.	All	internal	nodes	are COMBINE ;	when	both	children	are	present, COMBINE evaluates binary\_op ;	when	one child	is ∅ , COMBINE propagates	the	present	child	unchanged.	The	two ∅ positions	at	different	tree	levels	each	induce no	evaluation	of binary\_op .

A	near-balanced	tree	is	not	necessarily	full;	missing	leaves	may	induce	absent	operands	at	internal	combine	points as	the	tree	reduces.	The	lifted COMBINE rule	handles	this	uniformly.

## 4.3	Interleaved	topology	[canonical.reduce.interleaved]

Let E[0..N) denote	the	input	elements	in	iteration	order	and	let X[0..N) denote	the	corresponding	conceptual	terms of	the	reduction	expression	(materialization	and	the	reduction	state	type	are	defined	in	§4.6).

## 4.3.1	Lane	partitioning	by	index	modulo	[canonical.reduce.interleaved.partition]

For	each	lane	index j in [0,	L) ,	define:

```
I_j	=	<	i	in	[0,	N)	:	(i	mod	L)	==	j	>,	ordered	by	increasing	i. X_j	=	<	X[i]	:	i	in	I_j	>.
```

This	preserves	the	original	input	order	within	each	lane	(equivalently, X\_j contains	positions j,	j+L,	j+2L,	... that are	less	than N ).

## 4.3.2	Fixed-length	lane	leaves	(single	shape	per	lane)	[canonical.reduce.interleaved.leaves]

Define K	=	ceil(N	/	L) when N	>	0 (equivalently, K	=	(N	+	L	-	1)	/	L for	integers).	(The N	==	0 case	is	handled	by §4.5	and	does	not	form	lanes.)

For	each	lane j in [0,	L) ,	define	a	fixed-length	conceptual	sequence Y\_j[0..K) of maybe<A> leaves:

- for t in [0,	K)
- : let i	=	j	+	t*L if i	<	N : Y\_j[t]	=	present(	X[i]	) otherwise: Y\_j[t]	=	∅

Thus all	lanes	use	the	same	canonical	tree	shape	over K leaf	positions .	Lanes	with	fewer	than K elements simply	have	trailing ∅ leaves;	these	do	not	introduce	padding	values	and	do	not	require	identity-element	properties of binary\_op .

[ Note: Implementations	must	not	pad	absent	operand	positions	with	a	constant	value	(e.g., 0.0 for	addition)	unless that	value	is	the	identity	element	for	the	specific binary\_op and	argument	types.	The	lifted COMBINE rules	(§4.2.2) define	the	correct	handling	of	absent	positions	for	arbitrary binary\_op .	The	demonstrators	in	Appendix	K	use	zeropadding	only	because	they	test std::plus<double> with	non-negative	inputs,	for	which +0.0 is	a	suitable	padding value;	this	shortcut	does	not	generalize	(e.g.,	IEEE-754	signed	zero). -end	note ]

When N	<	L ,	some	lane	indices j correspond	to	no	input	positions: Y\_j[t]	==	∅ for	all t ,	yielding R\_j	==	∅ .	No applications	of binary\_op are	induced	for	such	lanes	under	the	lifted COMBINE rules.

[ Note: When L	>	N , K	=	1 and	each	lane	holds	at	most	one	element.	Stage	1	performs	no	applications	of binary\_op (each	lane	result	is	either	a	single	present	value	or ∅ ).	Stage	2	then	applies CANONICAL\_TREE\_EVAL over	the L lane results,	of	which	only N are	present;	the COMBINE rules	propagate	the L	-	N absent	entries	without	invoking binary\_op .	The	result	is	therefore	equivalent	to CANONICAL\_TREE\_EVAL applied	directly	to	the N input	elements.	In	this regime L has	no	observable	effect	on	the	returned	value.	This	is	intentional:	no	diagnostic	is	required,	and implementations	need	not	special	case	it.	In	this	regime,	multiple	lane	counts	may	denote	identical	abstract expressions;	this	does	not	affect	the	determinism	guarantee. -end	note ]

## 4.3.3	Interleaving	layout	diagrams	(informative)

Example: N	=	10 , L	=	4 ⇒ K	=	ceil(10/4)	=	3

```
Input	order	(i):			0			1			2			3			4			5			6			7			8			9 Elements	X[i]:				X0		X1		X2		X3		X4		X5		X6		X7		X8		X9 Lane	(i	mod	L):				0			1			2			3			0			1			2			3			0			1 Lanes	preserve	input	order	within	each	lane: Lane	0:	X0		X4		X8 Lane	1:	X1		X5		X9 Lane	2:	X2		X6 Lane	3:	X3		X7
```

Fixed-length	leaves	with	absence	(no	padding	values):

```
Y_0:	[	present(X0),	present(X4),	present(X8)	] Y_1:	[	present(X1),	present(X5),	present(X9)	] Y_2:	[	present(X2),	present(X6),	∅											] Y_3:	[	present(X3),	present(X7),	∅											]
```

## 4.3.4	Ragged	tail	handling	[canonical.reduce.interleaved.ragged]

When N is	not	a	multiple	of L ,	the	final	group	of	input	elements	is	incomplete:	some	lanes	receive	one	fewer	element than	others,	producing	a	ragged	trailing	edge	across	the	lane	partition.	The	canonical	expression	handles	this uniformly	through	the maybe<A> formalism	defined	in	§4.2.2.	Every	lane	uses	the	same	tree	shape	over K	=	ceil(N/L) leaf	positions,	but	lanes	whose	element	count	falls	short	of K have	trailing ∅ leaves.	The COMBINE rules	propagate these	absences	without	invoking binary\_op and	without	requiring	padding	values	or	identity	elements	from	the caller.

```
Example: N	=	11 , L	=	4 ,	so K	=	ceil(11/4)	=	3 .
```

The	input	is	distributed	across	lanes	by i	mod	L :

```
Input:			X0		X1		X2		X3	|	X4		X5		X6		X7	|	X8		X9		X10
```

```
Block:			────	full	────	|	────	full	────	|	─	ragged	──
```

Lane	assignment:

```
Lane	0:		X0,		X4,		X8							(3	elements	-	full) Lane	1:		X1,		X5,		X9							(3	elements	-	full) Lane	2:		X2,		X6,		X10						(3	elements	-	full) Lane	3:		X3,		X7,		∅								(2	elements	+	1	absent)
```

All	four	lanes	evaluate	the	same	canonical	tree	shape	over K	=	3 leaf	positions.	For	lanes	0-2,	every	leaf	is	present and	the	tree	evaluates	normally.	For	lane	3,	the	tree	encounters	an	absent	leaf:

<!-- image -->

COMBINE(op(X3,	X7),	∅)	=	op(X3,	X7) -	no binary\_op application	occurs	for	the	absent	position.	The	result	is identical	to	reducing	only	the	present	elements [X3,	X7] .

This	mechanism	generalizes	to	any (N,	L) pair.	The	number	of	ragged	lanes	is L	-	(N	mod	L) when N	mod	L	≠	0 ; these	lanes	each	have	exactly	one	trailing ∅ .	The	remaining N	mod	L lanes	have	all K positions	present.	When N is	a multiple	of L ,	no	lanes	are	ragged	and	no ∅ entries	arise.

In	implementation	terms,	the	ragged	tail	corresponds	to	the	familiar	SIMD	epilogue	or	tail-masking	pattern:	the final	group	of	elements	is	narrower	than	the	full	lane	width,	and	the	implementation	must	avoid	reading	or combining	nonexistent	data.	The maybe<A> formalism	specifies	the	required	behavior	without	prescribing	the implementation	technique	(masking,	scalar	epilogue,	predicated	lanes,	etc.).

## 4.4	Two-stage	reduction	semantics	[canonical.reduce.twostage]

The	returned	value	of	the	canonical	reduction	is	specified	as	if	by	the	following	sequence	of	evaluations.	This	twostage	decomposition	is	a	definitional	structure;	conforming	implementations	may	use	any	execution	strategy (threading,	SIMD,	GPU,	or	otherwise)	provided	the	returned	value	matches	that	of	the	specified	expression.

[ Note: This	paper	uses	'Stage	1'	and	'Stage	2'	as	conceptual	labels	for	the	per-lane	and	cross-lane	phases	of	the canonical	expression.	Future	standard	wording	may	adopt	different	presentational	conventions	(e.g.,	'steps'	or 'equivalent	to')	per	established	[numerics.ops]	practice;	the	normative	content	-	the	specified	expression	-	is independent	of	the	labeling. -end	note ]

Let L	>=	1 be	the	lane	count	and	let op denote	the	supplied binary\_op .

## 4.4.1	Stage	1	-	Per-lane	canonical	reduction	(single	tree	shape)	[canonical.reduce.twostage.perlane]

For	each	lane	index j in [0,	L) ,	define:

```
R_j	=	CANONICAL_TREE_EVAL(op,	Y_j)		//	returns	maybe<A>
```

## 4.4.2	Stage	2	-	Canonical	reduction	over	lane	results	(in	increasing	lane	index) [canonical.reduce.twostage.crosslane]

Define	a	conceptual	sequence Z[0..L) by:

- Z[j]	=	R\_j for j in [0,	L) .

Then	define:

```
R_all	=	CANONICAL_TREE_EVAL(op,	Z)		//	returns	maybe<A>
```

When N	>	0 ,	at	least	one	lane	contains	a	present	operand,	therefore R\_all is present(r) for	some r of	type A .	The interleaved	reduction	result	is	that r .

Therefore,	the	overall	expression	is	uniquely	determined	by	the	canonical	tree	rule	applied	first	within	each	lane	and then	across	lanes	in	increasing	lane	index	order.	When L	=	1 ,	there	is	a	single	lane	containing	all N elements;	Stage 2	receives	one	input	and	returns	it	unchanged,	so	the	result	is	simply CANONICAL\_TREE\_EVAL(op,	Y\_0) .

Summary	definition. For	convenience,	define	the	composite	definitional	function:

```
CANONICAL_INTERLEAVED_REDUCE(L,	op,	X[0..N)): Partition	X	into	L	lanes	by	index	modulo	(§4.3.1). Form	fixed-length	leaf	sequences	Y_j[0..K)	for	each	lane	j	(§4.3.2). For	each	lane	j:	R_j	=	CANONICAL_TREE_EVAL(op,	Y_j). Form	Z[0..L)	where	Z[j]	=	R_j. Return	CANONICAL_TREE_EVAL(op,	Z).
```

When N	==	0 , CANONICAL\_INTERLEAVED\_REDUCE is	not	invoked;	the	result	is	determined	by	§4.5.

## 4.4.3	Two-stage	diagrams	(informative)

Stage	1	summary	( N	=	10 , L	=	4 , K	=	3 ;	all	lanes	use	the	same	shape; ∅ propagates):

```
Y_0	=	[X0,	X4,	X8]	--(canonical	tree	k=3)-->	R_0 Y_1	=	[X1,	X5,	X9]	--(canonical	tree	k=3)-->	R_1 Y_2	=	[X2,	X6,	∅	]	--(canonical	tree	k=3)-->	R_2 Y_3	=	[X3,	X7,	∅	]	--(canonical	tree	k=3)-->	R_3
```

Stage	2	(cross-lane	canonical	reduction;	same	rules	apply):

```
Example:	L	=	4,	Z	=	[R0,	R1,	R2,	R3] combine /						\ combine			combine /				\				/				\ R0				R1		R2				R3
```

Conceptual	completeness:	the	same	lifted	rule	handles	absence	in	Stage	2:

```
Example:	Z	=	[	R0,	∅,	R2,	∅	] combine /						\ combine			combine /				\				/				\ R0				∅			R2				∅ combine(R0,	∅)	=	R0 combine(R2,	∅)	=	R2 combine(R0,	R2)	=	op(R0,	R2)

## 4.4.4	Equivalence	to	reducing	only	present	terms	(informative)

For	any	lane j , CANONICAL\_TREE\_EVAL(op,	Y\_j) evaluates	the	same	abstract	expression	as	applying	the	canonical	split rule	(§4.2.1)	to	the	subsequence X\_j containing	only	present	terms,	with	the	understanding	that	absent	operand positions	do	not	create binary\_op applications.	The	explicit	absence	notation	does	not	affect	the	returned	value;	it makes	the	'absent	operand'	behavior	precise	and	enables	a	single	tree	shape	for	all	lanes.

## 4.4.5	Value	propagation	[canonical.reduce.twostage.propagation]

Each	application	of binary\_op within	the	canonical	expression	is	performed	as	if	by:

```
op(lhs,	rhs)
```

where lhs and rhs are	the	values	produced	by	evaluating	the	corresponding	child	subexpressions,	each	of	type A (§4.6).

Propagation	through	an	absent	operand	(§4.2.2)	does	not	create	additional	copies	or	moves	of	the	present	operand; the	present	value	is	propagated	to	the	parent	node	unchanged.

[ Note: Implementations	are	free	to	move	from	intermediate	values	and	to	elide	copies	where	permitted	by	the	as-if rule;	this	specification	does	not	constrain	value	categories	of	intermediate	operands	beyond	the	returned-value contract. -end	note ]

## 4.5	Integration	of	an	initial	value	(if	provided)	[canonical.reduce.init]

The	returned	value	depends	on	whether	an	initial	value init is	provided	and	on N :

Case	1	init provided, N	==	0 : The	result	is A{init} .	No	evaluations	of binary\_op are	performed.

For	Cases	2-3	( N	>	0 ),	let R be	the	value	extracted	from R\_all	=	CANONICAL\_TREE\_EVAL(op,	Z) in	§4.4.2.

Case	2	init provided, N	>	0 : -	Let I be	a	value	of	type A initialized	from init (where A is	defined	in	§4.6).	-	The result	is op(I,	R) .

Case	3	-	no init provided, N	>	0 : -	The	result	is R .

Case	4	-	no init provided, N	==	0 : This	case	is	not	defined	by	the	expression	structure	in	§4.	A	conforming	API specification	shall	require N	>	0 as	a	precondition	for	any	no-init	overload	(or	else	not	provide	such	an	overload).

The	placement	of init is	normative.	In	particular, init is	not	interleaved	into	lanes	and	does	not	participate	in	the tree	expression.	Combining init with	the	tree	result	in	a	single	final	application	of binary\_op ensures	that	the	tree shape	is	independent	of	whether	an	initial	value	is	provided.	Placing init as	the	left	operand	preserves	laneassignment	invariance	under	extension	of	the	input	sequence	and	ensures	that	the	abstract	expression	stays	stable when	additional	elements	are	appended	to	the	range.

Appending	additional	elements	to	the	input	sequence	does	not	change	the	induced	abstract	subexpression	over	the original	prefix	elements;	newly	appended	elements	only	add	additional	operator	nodes	that	combine	previously formed	partial	results	with	the	appended	values.	The	left	placement	of init preserves	this	stability	property	for	nonassociative	operations.

Treating init as	an	input	element	would	change	the	lane	assignment	of	all	subsequent	elements	and	therefore	alter the	abstract	expression.

The	left-operand	placement	is	consistent	with	existing	fold-style	conventions;	because	this	proposal	does	not	require commutativity	of binary\_op ,	the	position	of init is	specified.	In	particular, std::accumulate places init as	the	left operand	at	every	step	( op(op(init,	x₀),	x₁)... );	this	proposal	preserves	that	convention	so	that	non-commutative operations	produce	consistent	results	when	migrating	from std::accumulate to	this	reduction.

[ Note: Whether	a	convenience	form	without	an	explicit init is	provided,	and	what	default	it	uses,	is	an	API	decision deferred	to	a	future	revision. -end	note ]

```
With	init	(conceptual): if	N	==	0:	Result	=	A{init} else: I	=	A{init} R	=	value(	CANONICAL_INTERLEAVED_REDUCE(L,	op,	X[0..N))	) Result	=	op(I,	R) init	is	not	interleaved	into	lanes	and	is	combined	once	with	the	overall	result.
```

Informative	contrast:

```
std::accumulate: (((init	op	X0)	op	X1)	op	X2)	...	op	XN-1 This	proposal: init	op	(	fixed	canonical	tree	expression	over	X0..XN-1	)
```

[ Note: This	differs	structurally	from std::accumulate ,	where init is	the	leftmost	operand	of	a	left-fold	and participates	in	every	step	of	the	evaluation.	In	this	proposal, init is	applied	exactly	once,	as	the	left	operand	to	the completed	tree	result.	While	both	conventions	place init on	the	left, std::accumulate threads init through N

applications	of binary\_op ,	whereas	this	reduction	applies binary\_op(I,	R) a	single	time	after	the	tree	evaluation. This	is	an	intentional	design	choice	(see	Appendix	E	for	rationale):	integrating init into	the	tree	would	alter	the	tree shape	and	break	the	independence	of	the	expression	from	the	presence	or	absence	of	an	initial	value. -end	note ]

## 4.6	Materialization	of	conceptual	terms	and	reduction	state	(introducing	V	and	A) [canonical.reduce.types]

The	preceding	sections	(§4.1-§4.4)	define	the	expression	structure	over	abstract	sequences.	This	section	specifies the	type	rules	that	bridge	the	abstract	expression	to	C++	evaluation.

Let:

- V be	the	value	type	of	the	input	sequence	elements,
- A be	the	reduction	state	type:
- if	an	initial	value init of	type	T	is	provided, A	=	remove\_cvref\_t<T> ;
- otherwise A	=	remove\_cvref\_t<V> .

Define	the	conceptual	term	sequence X[0..N) of	type	A	by	converting	each	input	element:

X[i]	=	static\_cast<A>(E[i]) for i	in	[0,	N) .

All	applications	of binary\_op within	the	definitional	functions	in	§4	operate	on	values	of	type	A.

Constraints: Let A be	the	reduction	state	type	defined	above.

- The	expression static\_cast<A>(E[i]) shall	be	well-formed	for	each	element E[i] of	the	input	range.
- When	an	initial	value init is	provided,	the	initialization A{init} shall	be	well-formed.
- binary\_op shall	be	invocable	with	two	arguments	of	type A ,	and	the	result	shall	be	convertible	to A .
- If	an	initial	value init is	provided,	it	is	materialized	as	a	value I of	type A initialized	from init and	participates	in the	expression	as op(I,	R) per	§4.5.

[ Note: How V is	derived	from	the	input	-	whether	as iter\_value\_t<InputIt> for	an	iterator-pair	interface, range\_value\_t<R> for	a	range	interface,	or	otherwise	-	is	an	API	decision	deferred	to	a	future	revision.	The semantic	contract	requires	only	that V is	well-defined	and	that	the	conversion static\_cast<A>(E[i]) is	well-formed. Proxy	reference	types	(e.g., std::vector<bool>::reference )	and	their	interaction	with V are	likewise	API-level concerns. -end	note ]

## 5.	Invariance	Properties	[canonical.reduce.invariance]

This	proposal	does not impose	associativity	or	commutativity	requirements	on binary\_op .	Instead	of	permitting implementations	to	reassociate	or	reorder	(which	can	make	results	unspecified	for	non-associative	operations),	this proposal	defines	a	single	abstract	expression	for	fixed (N,	L) .	Determinism	is	obtained	by	fixing	the	expression,	not by	restricting binary\_op .

For	a	chosen lane	count L ,	the	fixed	expression	structure	provides:

Topological	determinism: For	fixed	input	order, binary\_op ,	lane	count L ,	and N ,	the	abstract	expression	(grouping and	left/right	operand	order)	is	fully	specified	by	§4.	It	does	not	depend	on	implementation	choices,	SIMD	width, thread	count,	or	scheduling	decisions.

Layout	invariance: The	canonical	abstract	expression	defined	in	§4	depends	only	on	the	sequence	of	values obtained	from	the	iterator	range	in	iteration	order	and	the	lane	count L ;	it	does	not	depend	on	memory	addresses, alignment,	or	physical	data	placement.	The	returned	value	additionally	depends	on	the	floating-point	evaluation model	(§6).

Execution	independence: The	returned	value	is	determined	solely	by	the	canonical	expression	specified	in	§4. Implementations	may	evaluate	using	any	strategy	provided	the	returned	value	equals	that	of	evaluating	the canonical	expression	for	the	completed	input	sequence	of	length N .

Cross-invocation	reproducibility: Given	the	same	lane	count L ,	input	sequence, binary\_op ,	and	floating-point evaluation	model,	the	returned	value	is	stable	across	invocations	(it	is	the	value	of	the	same	specified	expression under	the	same	evaluation	model).

Scope	of	guarantee	(returned	value): The	run-to-run	stability	guarantee	applies	to	the returned	value of	the reduction.	The	relative	order	of	side	effects	of binary\_op is	unspecified	for	all	overloads.	For	execution-policy overloads,	side	effects	may	additionally	be	concurrent	(as	with	existing	parallel	algorithms).

Constraints	on binary\_op : Let A be	the	reduction	state	type	(§4.6).	No	algebraic	requirements	-	associativity, commutativity,	or	identity	element	-	are	imposed	on binary\_op .	The	requirements	on binary\_op are	invocability	with two	arguments	of	type A and	convertibility	of	the	result	to A .	The	algorithm	evaluates binary\_op exactly N	-	1 times for N	>	0 (and N total	when init is	provided;	see	§4.2.2	and	§4.5).	For	overloads	with	an	execution	policy, binary\_op is	additionally	an	element	access	function	subject	to [algorithms.parallel.exec] .

The	returned-value	guarantee	applies	only	when	evaluation	completes	normally.	When	evaluated	with	an	execution policy,	if	an	evaluation	of binary\_op exits	via	an	exception, std::terminate is	called,	consistent	with [algorithms.parallel.exceptions] .	The	canonical	expression	contains	O(N)	evaluations	of binary\_op (specifically,

N -	1 when N	>	0 ;	see	§4.2.2).

The	remaining	requirements	on	iterators,	value	types,	and	side	effects	match	those	of	the	corresponding std::reduce facility	([reduce]):

- When	evaluated	without	an	execution	policy, binary\_op shall	not	invalidate	iterators	or	subranges,	nor	modify elements	in	the	input	range.
- When	evaluated	with	an	execution	policy, binary\_op is	an	element	access	function	subject	to	the	requirements	in [algorithms.parallel.exec].

When	evaluated	without	an	execution	policy, binary\_op is	invoked	as	part	of	a	normal	library	algorithm	call;	this paper	does	not	require	concurrent	evaluation.	When	evaluated	with	an	execution	policy,	the	requirements	of [algorithms.parallel.exec]	additionally	apply.

The	run-to-run	stability	guarantee	applies	to	the	returned	value	when binary\_op is	functionally	deterministic	-	that is,	when	it	returns	the	same	result	for	the	same	operand	values.	If binary\_op reads	mutable	global	state,	uses random	number	generation,	or	is	otherwise	non-deterministic,	the	returned	value	may	vary	even	with	fixed	lane count L and	input.

[ Note: Functional	determinism	of binary\_op is	not	a	formal	requirement	(the	standard	cannot	enforce	functional purity),	but	an	observation	about	when	the	stability	guarantee	is	meaningful. -end	note ]

Cross-platform	reproducibility	requires	users	to	ensure	an	identical	lane	count L and	an	equivalent	floating-point evaluation	model	(§2.5,	§6).

## 6.	Floating-Point	Considerations	(Informative)

This	facility	removes	one	specific	source	of	variability	in	parallel	reductions:	implementation-permitted	reassociation and	reordering	of	the	reduction	expression.	It	does	not	attempt	to	address	all	sources	of	floating-point	nondeterminism.

Terminology: This	paper	uses	fl oating-point	evaluation	model to	mean	the	combination	of	the	program's runtime	floating-point	environment	(e.g., <cfenv> rounding	mode)	and	the	translation/target	choices	that	affect	how floating-point	expressions	are	evaluated	(e.g.,	contraction/FMA,	excess	precision,	subnormal	handling,	fast-math).

What	is	specified: For	a	given	topology	coordinate L ,	input	sequence, binary\_op ,	and init ,	the	result	is	the	value obtained	by	evaluating	the	canonical	expression	defined	in	§4,	in	the	floating-point	evaluation	model	in	effect	for	the program.

What	this	enables: By	removing	library-permitted	reassociation,	repeated	executions	of	the	same	program	under	a stable	evaluation	model	can	obtain	the	same	result	independent	of	thread	count,	scheduling,	or	SIMD	width.

What	it	does	not	attempt	to	specify: Cross-architecture	bitwise	identity	is	not	a	goal	of	this	paper.	Users	who require	bitwise	identity	must	additionally	control	the	relevant	evaluation-model	factors	and	use	an	identical	lane count L across	the	intended	platforms.

Relationship	to	P3375	(Reproducible	floating-point	results): Davidson's	P3375	[P3375R3]	addresses reproducible	floating-point	arithmetic	across	implementations,	proposing	mechanisms	to	specify	sufficient conformance	with	ISO/IEC	60559:2020	(including	correctly	rounded	functions).	This	proposal	and	P3375	are complementary:	this	paper	fixes	the expression	structure (parenthesization	and	operand	order)	of	a	parallel reduction,	while	P3375	addresses	the evaluation	model (rounding,	contraction,	intermediate	precision)	for	individual operations.	Together,	they	would	provide	two	key	conditions	for	cross-platform	bitwise	reproducibility	of	parallel reductions.	Neither	paper	alone	is	sufficient.

Relationship	to std::simd (P1928): The	canonical	expression	defined	in	§4	is	designed	to	compose	naturally	with SIMD	execution.	The	interleaved	topology	maps	directly	onto	vertical	operations	over basic\_vec values:	each contiguous	load	feeds	one	element	per	lane,	and	the	canonical	tree	over	each	lane's	subsequence	corresponds	to

successive	vertical	accumulations.	An	implementation	may	use std::simd operations	to	evaluate	the	canonical expression	efficiently;	the	semantic	contract	does	not	depend	on std::simd but	is	designed	to	be	SIMD-friendly.

The	horizontal reduce overload	for basic\_vec ([simd.reductions])	serves	a	different	role:	it	reduces	a	single	SIMD value	with GENERALIZED\_SUM semantics	(both	operand	order	and	parenthesization	unspecified).	This	proposal's	crosslane	combination	(Stage	2	of	§4.4)	specifies	the	horizontal	reduction	order	that GENERALIZED\_SUM leaves	open.

Relationship	to	P0350	(Integrating	simd	with	parallel	algorithms): Kretz's	P0350	[P0350R4]	proposes	an execution::simd policy	that	processes	data	in	chunks	whose	width	is	determined	by	the	target's	native	SIMD register	(i.e., native\_simd<T>::size() ).	The	two	proposals	address	orthogonal	concerns:	P0350	specifies	an execution	strategy for	SIMD	hardware;	this	paper	specifies	an expression	structure for	deterministic	results.

The	designs	compose	naturally.	When	the	user's	chosen	lane	count L equals	the	native	SIMD	width,	or	is	a	whole multiple	of	it,	the	canonical	expression's	lane	structure	aligns	directly	with	the	physical	vector	registers	-	each contiguous	vector	load	feeds	exactly	the	lanes	that	the	canonical	tree	expects.	This	is	the	intended	usage	pattern: choose L to	match	(or	be	a	multiple	of)	the	deployment	target's	SIMD	width.	The	mechanism	by	which L is	supplied to	the	algorithm	(template	parameter,	policy	argument,	or	composition	of	algorithm	and	policy)	is	an	API	question deferred	to	a	subsequent	revision.

The	C++ <cfenv> floating-point	environment	covers	rounding	mode	and	exception	flags;	many	other	factors	that affect	floating-point	results	(such	as	contraction/FMA	and	intermediate	precision)	are	translation-	or	targetdependent	and	are	not	fully	specified	by	the	C++	abstract	machine.	This	proposal	therefore	guarantees	expression identity,	not	universal	bitwise	identity.

## 7.	Relationship	to	Existing	Facilities	(Informative)

This	paper	specifies	a	canonical	expression	structure	for	parallel	reduction.	The	goal	is	to	complete	the	reduction 'semantic	spectrum'	in	the	Standard	Library:	from	specified	but	sequential,	to	parallel	but	unspecified,	to	parallel and	specified.

| HPC frameworks (Kokkos, etc.)                          | Yes        | Same-config deterministic; not across thread counts or backends | Library-internal tree; expression varies with runtime configuration                           |
| oneTBB parallel_reduce / parallel_deterministic_reduce | Yes        | Schedule-deterministic (not expression-specified)               | Fixed join order with deterministic variant; tree shape is library- defined, not standardized |
| Canonical reduction (this proposal)                    | Yes        | Yes (§4 tree)                                                   | Fixed parenthesization for chosen topology coordinate L; free scheduling                      |

What	this	proposal	adds: a	standard-specified	expression	for	parallel	reduction,	closing	the	third	cell	in	the	table above.

Standard	specification	models	for	unordered	summation. The	Standard	defines	two	recursive	summation models	in	[numerics.defns]	that	differ	in	how	much	freedom	the	implementation	has:

GENERALIZED\_NONCOMMUTATIVE\_SUM preserves	the	operand	order	of	the	input	sequence	but	leaves	the	choice	of	split point	unspecified	-	the	implementation	may	parenthesise	the	expression	any	way	it	likes.	This	is	the	model	used	by inclusive\_scan and exclusive\_scan .

GENERALIZED\_SUM goes	further:	it	permits	any	permutation	of	the	operands and any	parenthesisation.	This	is	the model	used	by std::reduce and std::transform\_reduce .

The	canonical	reduction	expression	proposed	here	fixes	both	degrees	of	freedom:	operand	ordering	is	determined	by interleaved	lane	assignment	(§4),	and	parenthesisation	is	determined	by	the	canonical	iterative	pairwise-with-carry tree	(near-balanced;	exactly	balanced	for	power-of-two	leaf	counts)	(§4.1).	For	a	given	lane	count L ,	there	is	exactly one	conforming	abstract	expression.

[ Note: 'Unique	expression'	means	the	standard	fully	specifies	a	single	abstract	expression	-	one	parenthesization and	one	operand	ordering	of binary\_op applications. accumulate specifies	a	unique	left	fold.

## 8.	Motivation	and	Use	Cases	(Informative)

This	proposal	is	motivated	by	workloads	where	run-to-run	stability	matters,	but	existing	parallel	reductions	are intentionally	free	to	choose	an	evaluation	order	(and	thus	may	vary	with	scheduling).	Typical	use	cases	include:

- CI	regression	testing: A	reduction	that	is	stable	across	runs	eliminates	intermittent	test	failures	and	enables 'golden	value'	comparisons.
- Debugging	and	bisection: A	stable	result	makes	it	practical	to	reproduce	and	minimize	numerical	regressions without	chasing	schedule-dependent	drift.
- Auditability	/	reproducible	analytics: Regulatory	or	scientific	workflows	often	require	re-running computations	and	obtaining	the	same	result	within	a	defined	environment.
- Large-scale	simulation	and	ML	training: Stable	aggregation	of	large	sums	(e.g.,	gradients,	risk	factors) improves	repeatability	of	model	training	and	scenario	analysis.
- Heterogeneous	execution: A	single	semantic	contract	that	can	be	implemented	on	CPU	and	GPU	enables consistent	verification,	even	when	the	execution	strategy	differs.

Detailed	examples	(with	code)	are	collected	in	Appendix	M.

## 9.	API	Design	Space	(Informative)

This	section	sketches	possible	directions	for	exposing	the	canonical	expression	defined	in	§4.	The	intent	is	to	build consensus	on	the	semantic	contract	before	committing	to	an	API	surface.

A	foundational	design	constraint	is	that	the	semantic	topology	parameter	is	the	lane	count L .	Any	API	surface	must expose L explicitly	to	ensure	that	the	user's	chosen	abstract	expression	stays	stable	across	different	compilers, operating	systems,	and	architectures.

Two	primary	approaches	exist.

## 9.1	New	Algorithm	Approach	(Illustrative)

We	propose	exposing	the	semantics	as	a	new	algorithm	parameterized	by L via	a	non-type	template	parameter (NTTP).	This	ensures	the	chosen	expression	topology	is	a	compile-time	property	of	the	algorithm	call.

```
//	Illustrative	only:	name/signature	not	proposed	in	this	paper namespace std	{ //	Sequential	/	Unsequenced	evaluation	(constexpr	friendly) template <size_t	L, class InputIt, class T, class BinaryOp> constexpr T	canonical_reduce(InputIt	first,	InputIt	last,	T	init,	BinaryOp	op); //	Execution	policy	overloads template <size_t	L, class ExecutionPolicy, class ForwardIt, class T, class BinaryOp> T	canonical_reduce(ExecutionPolicy&&	policy, ForwardIt	first,	ForwardIt	last,	T	init,	BinaryOp	op); }
```

Rationale: The	choice	of	topology L alters	the	abstract	expression,	which	intentionally	affects	observable	results	for non-associative	operations	(e.g.,	floating-point	addition).	This	argues	for	an	API	whose	contract	explicitly	includes the	topology	coordinate	in	the	type	system,	rather	than	treating	topology	as	an	implementation	detail	or	an execution	hint.

## 9.2	Rationale:	Why	Lane	Count	(L)	is	the	Sole	Coordinate	(The	Portability	Trap)

Earlier	explorations	of	this	facility	considered	offering	an	added	'numerics	convenience'	parameter M (representing a	span	in	bytes),	where	the	algorithm	would	derive	the	lane	count	via L	=	M	/	sizeof(value\_type) .

This	paper	explicitly	rejects	a	byte-span	( M )	API	due	to	the	portability	trap	it	creates.

If	a	user	requests	a	64-byte	span	(e.g., canonical\_reduce<64> ),	the	derived L depends	entirely	on sizeof(T) . Consider long	double :

- On	MSVC	(x86\_64), sizeof(long	double) is	8	bytes. L becomes	8.
- On	GCC/Clang	(x86\_64	Linux), sizeof(long	double) is	16	bytes. L becomes	4.

Changing L inherently	changes	the	parenthesization	and	operand	order	of	the	abstract	tree.	Therefore,	an	API	based on M would	silently	generate	fundamentally	different	mathematical	expressions	on	different	platforms	for	the	exact same	source	code,	destroying	the	cross-platform	run-to-run	stability	this	paper	seeks	to	provide.

By	enforcing L as	the	sole	topology	coordinate,	the	C++	Standard	guarantees	expression	identity: canonical\_reduce<16>(...) evaluates	the	exact	same	tree	on	an	ARM	processor	as	it	does	on	an	x86	processor, regardless	of	how	the	underlying	types	are	represented	in	memory.

If	users	wish	to	align L with	a	specific	cache-line	or	hardware	width,	they	can	explicitly	calculate	it	at	the	call	site (e.g., canonical\_reduce<64	/	sizeof(T)>(...) ),	making	the	representation-size	dependency	explicit	in	source	code.

## 9.3	Execution	Policy	Approach	(Illustrative)

Expose	the	semantics	as	a	new	execution	policy	(illustrative	spelling	only):

```
//	Illustrative	only:	policy	type/spelling	not	proposed	in	this	paper template <size_t	L> struct canonical_policy	{ /*	...	*/ };
```

This	approach	integrates	naturally	with	the	existing	parallel	algorithms	vocabulary.	However,	as	established	in	§3.0, execution	policies	in	the	current	standard	are	designed	to	constrain scheduling ,	not expression	structure .	Encoding topology	in	a	policy	would	require	the	policy	to	carry	semantic	guarantees	about	the	returned	value	-	a	role	that policies	do	not	currently	play.	It	also	raises	unresolved	questions	about	policy	composition:	what	happens	when	two policies	specify	conflicting	topologies,	or	when	a	topology-carrying	policy	composes	with	one	that	permits reassociation?

## 9.4	Trade-offs	(Informative)

The	expression/algorithm/execution	analysis	in	§3.0	informs	this	trade-off:

- A	dedicated	algorithm	places	expression	ownership	where	the	standard	already	locates	semantic	contracts:	in the	algorithm.	The	topology	coordinate	is	explicit,	composition	questions	do	not	arise,	and	the	facility	can	be taught	as	'this	algorithm	computes this expression'	-	parallel	to	how std::accumulate computes	a	left	fold.
- A	policy-based	approach	may	reduce	algorithm	surface	area	but	conflates	expression	and	execution	-	the	same conflation	that	§3.0	identifies	as	a	source	of	confusion	around std::reduce and execution::seq .	It	would	also require	new	rules	for	policy	dominance	and	semantic	interaction	that	do	not	exist	in	the	current	standard.

## 9.5	Naming	Considerations	(Informative)

This	paper	uses canonical\_reduce<L>(...) as	the	illustrative	spelling,	reflecting	that	lane	count L is	the	semantic topology	coordinate.	Final	naming	should	communicate	that:

- the	return	value	is	defined	by	a	specified	abstract	expression;	and
- the	topology	coordinate	is	part	of	the	semantic	contract.

## 9.6	Topology	Defaults	and	Named	Presets	(Informative)

To	prevent	silent	semantic	drift	across	targets,	the	Standard	should	not	leave	the	default	topology	implementationdefined.	Instead,	a	small	set	of	standard-fixed	named	presets	for	the	lane	count L may	be	provided.

```
namespace std	{ inline constexpr size_t	canonical_lanes_narrow	=	16; inline constexpr size_t	canonical_lanes_wide			=	128; inline constexpr size_t	canonical_lanes_single	=	1; }
```

Typical	call	sites:

```
auto a	=	std::canonical_reduce<std::canonical_lanes_narrow>( v.begin(),	v.end(),	0.0,	std::plus<>{}); auto b	=	std::canonical_reduce<std::canonical_lanes_wide>( v.begin(),	v.end(),	0.0,	std::plus<>{}); auto reference	=	std::canonical_reduce<std::canonical_lanes_single>( v.begin(),	v.end(),	0.0,	std::plus<>{});
```

[ Note: Appendix	J	provides	an	indicative	'straw-man'	API	using	these	presets	without	committing	the	committee	to a	final	spelling	or	placement. -end	note ]

## Practical	topology	selection	guidance	(informative)

The	semantic	coordinate	is L .	Performance	is	often	improved	when L aligns	with	the	target's	preferred	execution granularity,	but	the	Standard	does	not	prescribe	hardware	behavior.

- CI/CD	and	cross-platform	verification	baseline: choose L	=	1 ,	yielding	a	single	global	canonical	tree.
- Typical	CPU	deployment: choose L matching	the	target	SIMD	lane	count	(e.g., L	=	4 for	AVX2/double, L	=	8 for AVX-512/double).
- GPU	warp-level	consistency: choose L	=	warp\_width (e.g., L	=	32 on	NVIDIA	GPUs).

| Use case             |   L (double) |   L (float) | Notes                                                  |
|----------------------|--------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Golden reference     |            1 |           1 | Single tree; for debugging/golden values               |
| Portability baseline |            2 |           4 | SSE/NEON width                                         |
| AVX / AVX2           |            4 |           8 | Desktop/server AVX2                                    |
| AVX-512              |            8 |          16 | AVX-512 servers                                        |
| CUDA warp            |           32 |          32 | 32-thread warp; L maps to thread count, not data width |

## Appendix	A:	Illustrative	Wording	(Informative)

This	appendix	is	illustrative;	no	API	is	proposed	in	this	paper	(§2).	It	shows	one	way	the	semantic	definition	could	be expressed	for	a	future	Standard	Library	facility.	Names,	headers,	and	final	API	shape	are	intentionally	provisional, and	any	eventual	interface	may	differ	materially.

## A.1	Example	Algorithm	Specification

The	following	shows	how	the	semantic	definition	could	be	expressed	for	a	hypothetical	algorithm	that	exposes	the lane	count L :

- L	(lane	count): the	sole	semantic	topology	coordinate.	The	canonical	expression	is	fully	determined	by (N,	L) .

```
//	Lane-based	topology	(portable	across	ABIs	for	a	fixed	L) template <size_t	L, class InputIterator, class T, class BinaryOperation> constexpr T	canonical_reduce(InputIterator	first,	InputIterator	last,	T	init, BinaryOperation	binary_op); template <size_t	L, class ExecutionPolicy, class ForwardIterator, class T, class BinaryOperation> T	canonical_reduce(ExecutionPolicy&&	policy, ForwardIterator	first,	ForwardIterator	last,	T	init, BinaryOperation	binary_op);
```

[ Note: The	illustrative	wording	marks	the	non-policy	overloads constexpr .	The	canonical	expression	is	a	pure functional	specification	with	no	dependence	on	runtime	state	-	it	is	structurally	amenable	to	constant	evaluation. The	tree	evaluation	corresponds	to	a	finite	canonical	expression	(a	finite	set	of binary\_op applications)	whose structure	is	statically	determined,	which	is	compatible	with	constexpr	evaluation	provided binary\_op is	itself constexpr.	Full	constexpr	feasibility	depends	on	whether	the	API	ultimately	uses	iterators	(which	have	constexpr limitations	for	some	container	types)	or	ranges.	Detailed	constexpr	specification	is	deferred	to	the	API	design	paper. -end	note ]

Constraints: -	For	overloads	with	an	ExecutionPolicy,	ForwardIterator	meets	the	Cpp17ForwardIterator requirements.

Mandates: -L	>=	1 .

## A.2	Semantics	(as-if)

A	conforming	implementation	returns	a	value	that	is	as-if	evaluation	of	the	canonical	abstract	expression	defined	in §4,	which	may	be	constructed	conceptually	as	follows:

1. Materialize	terms. Form	the	conceptual	sequence	of	terms X[0..N) by	converting	each	input	element	to	the reduction	state	type A as	specified	in	§4.6.
2. Partition	into	lanes. Partition	terms	into L logical	lanes	by	index	modulo	as	specified	in	§4.3.1.
3. Form	fixed-length	lane	leaves	with	absence. Let K	=	ceil(N	/	L) (for N	>	0 ).	For	each	lane	index j in [0,	L) , form	a	fixed-length	leaf	sequence Y\_j[0..K) of maybe<A> where Y\_j[t] is present(X[j	+	t*L]) when j	+	t*L	<	N , and ∅ otherwise	(§4.3.2).

Informative: When N	<	L ,	some	lane	indices	have	no	corresponding	input	positions;	such	lanes	are	best	understood as	'no	lane	data	exists'.	In	the	canonical	expression	this	is	represented	by Y\_j[t]	==	∅ for	all t ,	yielding R\_j	==	∅ .

4. Per-lane	canonical	reduction. For	each	lane	index j ,	compute R\_j	=	CANONICAL\_TREE\_EVAL(binary\_op,	Y\_j) using	the	pairwise	reduction	tree	shape	and	the	lifted COMBINE rules	for ∅ (§4.2-§4.4.1).
5. Cross-lane	canonical	reduction. Form Z[0..L) where Z[j]	=	R\_j and	compute R\_all	= CANONICAL\_TREE\_EVAL(binary\_op,	Z) (§4.4.2).
6. Integrate init (if	provided). If	an	initial	value	is	provided,	the	result	is init when N	==	0 ,	otherwise binary\_op(init,	value(R\_all)) ,	as	specified	in	§4.5.

[ Note: init is	combined	once	with	the	total	result	and	is	not	treated	as	an	additional	input	element;	treating	it	as	an extra	element	would	shift	lane	assignments	and	change	the	selected	canonical	expression	topology. -end	note ]

Informative: An	implementation	may	skip	forming	absent	leaves	and	lanes	that	contain	no	elements,	provided	the returned	value	is	as-if	evaluation	of	the	canonical	expression	(since ∅ does	not	induce	applications	of binary\_op ).

## Appendix	B:	Implementation	Guidance	(Informative)

This	appendix	offers	detailed	guidance	for	implementers.	It	is	informative	only;	the	normative	specification	is	the canonical	expression	defined	in	§4.

General	principle: Implementations	need	not	instantiate	lanes	for	empty	subsequences;	only	the	logical	reduction structure	(the	canonical	expression)	must	be	preserved.	For	example,	if	L	=	1000	but	N	=	5,	the	implementation need	not	allocate	1000	accumulators	-	only	the	5	non-empty	subsequences	take	part	in	the	final	reduction.

## B.1	Two	Degrees	of	Parallelism

Real	implementations	exploit	two	orthogonal	forms	of	parallelism:

| Parallelism   | Mechanism                   | Typical Scale   |
|---------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| SIMD          | Vector registers, GPU warps | 4-64 lanes      |
| Threads       | CPU cores, GPU blocks       | 4-thousands     |

This	leads	to	two	levels	of	reduction:

```
FINAL	RESULT | +-----------+-----------+ |			THREAD	REDUCTION				|	<--	Combine	thread	results +-----------+-----------+ | +---------------+---------------+ |															|															| +-----+-----+			+-----+-----+			+-----+-----+ |			SIMD				|			|			SIMD				|			|			SIMD				| |	REDUCTION	|			|	REDUCTION	|			|	REDUCTION	| +-----------+			+-----------+			+-----------+
```

Both	levels	must	produce	results	matching	the	canonical	expression.

## B.2	The	Efficient	SIMD	Pattern

The	canonical	expression	supports	efficient	vertical	addition:

For	L	=	4,	N	=	16:

```
Load	V0	=	{E[0],	E[1],	E[2],	E[3]}	→	Acc	=	V0 Load	V1	=	{E[4],	E[5],	E[6],	E[7]}	→	Acc	=	Acc	+	V1 Load	V2	=	{E[8],	E[9],	E[10],	E[11]}	→	Acc	=	Acc	+	V2 Load	V3	=	{E[12],	E[13],	E[14],	E[15]}	→	Acc	=	Acc	+	V3 Acc	now	holds	{R_0,	R_1,	R_2,	R_3} Final	horizontal	reduction:	op(op(R_0,	R_1),	op(R_2,	R_3))
```

This	is	contiguous	loads	plus	vertical	adds	-	optimal	for	SIMD.

## B.3	Thread-Level	Partitioning

With	multiple	threads,	each	processes	a	contiguous	chunk:

```
Thread	0:	E[0..256)	→	{R_0^T0,	R_1^T0,	R_2^T0,	R_3^T0} Thread	1:	E[256..512)	→	{R_0^T1,	R_1^T1,	R_2^T1,	R_3^T1} ... Thread	partial	results	are	combined	per	lane,	then	across	lanes: Global	R_0	=	CANONICAL_TREE_EVAL(op,	{R_0^T0,	R_0^T1,	...}) Global	R_1	=	CANONICAL_TREE_EVAL(op,	{R_1^T0,	R_1^T1,	...}) ... Final	=	CANONICAL_TREE_EVAL(op,	{R_0,	R_1,	R_2,	R_3})
```

## B.4	GPU	Implementation

The	sequence	maps	to	GPU	architectures:

```
//	Vertical	addition	within	block for (size_t	base	=	0;	base	<	n;	base	+=	L)	{ size_t	idx	=	base	+	lane; if (idx	<	n)	acc	=	op(acc,	input[idx]); } //	Horizontal	reduction	(assumes	L	is	a	power	of	two) for (size_t	stride	=	L/2;	stride	>	0;	stride	/=	2)	{ if (lane	<	stride)	shared[lane]	=	op(shared[lane],	shared[lane	+	stride]); __syncthreads(); } //	Cross-block:	fixed	slots,	not	atomics block_results[blockIdx.x]	=	shared[0]; //	Deterministic	position
```

Key	constraints: -	Static	work	assignment	(no	work	stealing)	-	Fixed	block	result	slots	(no	atomicAdd)	-	Canonical tree	for	horizontal	reduction

[ Note: This	GPU	sketch	is	illustrative	and	non-normative;	it	demonstrates	one	possible	mapping	of	the	canonical expression	to	a	GPU	kernel	and	is	not	intended	to	constrain	implementation	strategy. -end	note ]

## B.5	Cross-Platform	Consistency

The	proposal	defines	the	expression	structure.	All	conforming	implementations	evaluate	as-if	by	the	same	canonical abstract	expression	for	a	given	topology	coordinate L .

Within	a	single,	controlled	environment (same	ISA/backend,	same	compiler	and	flags,	and	equivalent	floatingpoint	evaluation	models),	this	removes	the	run-to-run	variability	of std::reduce by	fixing	the	reduction	tree.

Across	architectures/backends (CPU	↔	CPU,	CPU	↔	GPU):	the	facility	guarantees	expression/topology equivalence	-	i.e.,	the	same	abstract	tree	is	specified.	Achieving	bitwise	identity	additionally	requires	aligning	the floating-point	evaluation	environment	(§2.5,	§6).

## B.5.1	Requirements	for	Cross-Platform	Bitwise	Reproducibility

This	proposal	standardizes	the	abstract	expression	structure	(parenthesization	and	operand	order).	Bitwise-identical results	across	different	platforms,	compilers,	or	architectures	generally	require	that	fixed	expression	structure	and an	equivalent	floating-point	evaluation	environment.

[ Note: For	fundamental	floating-point	types	with	non-associative	operations	(e.g.,	float,	double	with std::plus ), factors	that	commonly	affect	bitwise	results	include	(non-exhaustive):

1. Floating-point	format	and	evaluation	rules: whether	the	type	and	operations	follow	ISO/IEC/IEEE	60559 (IEEE	754)	and	whether	intermediate	precision	differs	(e.g.,	extended	precision).
2. Rounding	mode: both	executions	use	the	same	rounding	mode	(typically	round-to-nearest	ties-to-even).
3. Contraction	/	FMA: whether	multiply-add	sequences	are	fused/contracted,	and	whether	contraction	behavior matches	across	backends.
4. Subnormal	handling: whether	subnormals	are	preserved	or	flushed	to	zero	(FTZ/DAZ).
5. Transforming	optimizations: 'fast-math'	style	options	that	permit	reassociation	or	relax	IEEE	behavior.
6. Library	math	and	user	operations: if binary\_op (or	upstream	transformations	such	as views::transform )	call implementation-defined	math	libraries,	results	may	differ.
7. Topology	selection	and	input	order: both	sides	use	identical	topology	coordinate	( L )	and	the	same	input	order.

## -end	note ]

What	this	proposal	guarantees: for	fixed	topology	coordinate,	input	order,	and binary\_op ,	the	abstract	expression (parenthesization	and	operand	order)	is	identical	across	all	conforming	implementations.

What	remains	platform-specific: the	floating-point	evaluation	model	(items	above).	Aligning	it	may	require toolchain	controls	(for	example,	disabling	contraction	and	avoiding	fast-math;	exact	spellings	are	toolchain-specific).

Verification	workflow: the	demonstrators	in	Appendix	K	use	a	fixed	seed	and	publish	expected	hex	outputs	for representative	topology	coordinates.	Matching	those	values	across	platforms	validates	both	(a)	correct	expression structure	(this	proposal)	and	(b)	sufficiently	aligned	floating-point	environments	(user	responsibility).

## Illustrative	CPU	↔	GPU	check:

```
//	Compile	and	run	both	sides	under	equivalent	FP	settings	(toolchain-specific). double	cpu	=	canonical_reduce<16>(data.begin(),	data.end(),	0.0,	std::plus<>{}); double	gpu	=	cuda_canonical_reduce<16>(d_data,	N,	0.0); //	Bitwise	equality	is	achievable	when	the	FP	evaluation	environments	are	aligned	(see	§6): assert(std::bit_cast<uint64_t>(cpu)	==	std::bit_cast<uint64_t>(gpu));
```

This	enables	'golden	result'	workflows	where	a	reference	evaluation	can	act	as	a	baseline	for	accelerator correctness	verification.

## B.6	When	Physical	Width	≠	Logical	Width

Physical	>	Logical (e.g.,	256	GPU	threads,	L	=	8):	Multiple	threads	cooperate	on	each	logical	lane.	Partial	results combine	using	the	canonical	tree.

Physical	<	Logical (e.g.,	4	physical	SIMD	lanes,	L	=	16	logical	lanes):	Process	logical	lanes	in	chunks	across multiple	physical	iterations.	The	logical	sequence	is	unchanged;	only	the	physical	execution	differs.

## B.7	Performance	Characteristics

Representative	measurements	appear	in	Appendix	N	(Performance	feasibility).	With	proper	SIMD	optimization	(8block	unrolling),	the	reference	implementation	indicates	that	the	canonical	expression	structure	can	be	evaluated	at throughput	comparable	to	unconstrained	reduction,	suggesting	that	conforming	implementations	need	not	incur prohibitive	overhead.	Observed	overhead	is	workload-	and	configuration-dependent;	see	also	the	demonstrators	in Appendix	K	for	platform	observations.

## Appendix	C:	Prior	Art	and	Industry	Practice	(Informative)

The	tension	between	parallel	performance	and	numerical	reproducibility	is	a	long-standing	challenge	in	highperformance	computing	(HPC)	and	distributed	systems.	In	practice,	many	frameworks	prioritize	throughput	by permitting	schedule-dependent	reduction	structures;	when	operations	are	non-associative	(e.g.,	floating-point addition),	different	reduction	trees	can	yield	different	results.	This	appendix	summarizes	representative	approaches and	their	limitations	relative	to	the	'Grouping	Gap.'

## C.1	Kokkos	Ecosystem	(HPC	Portability)

Kokkos	is	a	widely	used	C++	programming	model	for	performance	portability	in	HPC.	Kokkos	does	not	generally specify	a	fixed	reduction	expression	for parallel\_reduce or parallel\_scan :	the	documentation	notes	that	neither concurrency	nor	order	of	execution	are	guaranteed.	As	a	result,	floating-point	results	for	non-associative	operations may	vary	across	thread	counts,	backend	configurations,	or	architectures	as	the	library-internal	reduction	structure changes.

In	practice,	users	who	require	stronger	reproducibility	across	configurations	(e.g.,	scaling	studies,	regression testing	across	cluster	generations,	or	reproducible	validation	pipelines)	often	adopt	workarounds	such	as	fixedtopology	reductions,	compensated/exact	summation	techniques,	or	application-level	deterministic	accumulation strategies	-	at	non-trivial	implementation	cost.

This	paper's	lane-interleaved	topology	(§4.3)	is	motivated	by	common	'lane/warp'	optimization	patterns	in	HPC backends,	but	elevates	the	topology	to	a	standardized	semantic	contract:	the	reduction	expression	is	determined	by the	user-chosen	topology	coordinate L ,	not	by	runtime	configuration.

## C.2	Intel	oneAPI	Threading	Building	Blocks	(oneTBB)

oneTBB	is	a	widely	used	library	for	task-parallel	programming	on	CPUs.	Its parallel\_reduce facility	uses	a	recursive splitting	strategy	to	partition	work	into	sub-ranges	reduced	locally,	then	combines	partial	results.	When	scheduling is	dynamic	(e.g.,	work-stealing),	the	timing	and	grouping	of	joins	can	vary	across	runs,	and	thus	the	realized reduction	tree	can	be	schedule-dependent.	This	can	produce	different	floating-point	results	for	non-associative operations	even	when	the	input	order	is	unchanged.

To	address	this,	oneTBB	provides parallel\_deterministic\_reduce ,	which	aims	to	make	the	reduction	deterministic with	respect	to	an	internal	split/join	structure	for	a	given	configuration	(range	+	partitioner/grain	choices),	reducing run-to-run	variability	caused	purely	by	scheduling.	However,	the	tree	shape	remains	library-defined	and configuration-dependent:	changing	the	partitioner,	grain	size,	or	other	configuration	choices	may	change	the internal	tree	and	thus	the	result.	The	key	contrast	with	the	canonical	reduction	proposed	in	§4	is	that	this	proposal specifies	a	standard-defined	expression	determined	solely	by	(input	order, N , L )	-	independent	of	thread	count, partitioner,	or	runtime	environment.

## C.3	NVIDIA	Thrust	and	CUB

For	GPU	architectures,	NVIDIA	provides	the	Thrust	and	CUB	libraries.

Thrust: Typically	prioritizes	throughput.	Depending	on	the	backend	and	algorithm,	implementations	may	employ techniques	(including	schedule-dependent	mechanisms)	that	can	lead	to	run-to-run	variability	for	non-associative operations.	Consequently,	floating-point	results	may	vary	across	runs	and	configurations.

CUB: Provides	lower-level	'block-level'	and	'warp-level'	primitives	and	data-movement	utilities	designed	for	high bandwidth.	CUB	documentation	describes	striped	access	patterns	(where	consecutive	threads	access	consecutive items)	used	to	achieve	coalesced	memory	behavior.	The	interleaved	subsequences	(S\_j)	defined	in	§4.3	closely correspond	to	this	striped	access/layout	pattern	(without	implying	identical	algorithms	or	guarantees)	[NvidiaCUB].

## C.4	Academic	and	Research	Solutions

A	substantial	literature	addresses	reproducible	summation	and	reproducible	reductions.	One	class	of	techniques targets	reproducibility	independent	of	summation	order	(often	via	error-free	transformations,	compensated methods,	or	controlled	rounding/error-bound	strategies).	These	methods	can	provide	strong	reproducibility properties	but	may	impose	significant	overhead	and/or	require	more	complex	accumulator	representations.

A	second	class	enforces	a	specific	reduction	topology	(fixed	expression	structure).	This	paper	follows	the	fixedtopology	approach:	rather	than	attempting	to	standardize	an	'exact	summation'	method	with	potentially	large	and architecture-dependent	cost,	it	standardizes	the	reduction	expression	structure.	This	enables	reproducible	results for	a	given	platform	under	a	specified	expression	contract,	while	permitting	efficient	realization	via threads/SIMD/work-stealing/GPU	kernels.

## Appendix	D:	Standard	Wording	for	Fixed	Abstract	Expression	Structure (Informative)

In	the	C++	Standard,	some	sequential	algorithms	such	as std::accumulate and std::ranges::fold\_left define	a fully	specified abstract	expression	structure for	the	returned	value.	Informally,	they	define	a	left	fold	over	the input	range.

Important	distinction: This	paper	follows	that expression	identity model.	The	guarantee	is	about	the	value	being defined	by	a	fixed	abstract	expression, not about	portable	sequencing	of	side	effects,	and not about	bitwise reproducibility.	Even	with	the	same	abstract	expression,	results	may	differ	across	compilers	or	platforms	due	to floating-point	evaluation	conditions	(see	§6	and	§D.5).	Conversely,	when	floating-point	conditions	are	sufficiently aligned,	a	fixed	abstract	expression	removes	parenthesization/topology	as	a	source	of	variation.

The	guarantee	being	sought	here	is: the	returned	value	is	defined	by	the	abstract	expression .	The	relative order/timing	of	side	effects	of binary\_op is	not	the	objective	of	this	paper.

## D.1	std::accumulate

The	expression-structure	guarantee	for std::accumulate is	found	in	the	Numerics	library	section	of	the	Standard.

Section: [accumulate]/2

The	Text: The	Standard	defines	the	behavior	of accumulate(first,	last,	init,	binary\_op) as:

'Computes	its	result	by	initializing	the	accumulator	acc	with	the	initial	value	init	and	then	modifies	it	with acc	= std::move(acc)	+	*i or acc	=	binary\_op(std::move(acc),	*i) for	every	iterator	i	in	the	range	[first,	last)	in order.'

What	this	guarantees: The	abstract	expression	structure	is	fixed	as (((init	+	a)	+	b)	+	c)... .	The	grouping	is fully	specified	for	the	purpose	of	defining	the	returned	value	-	there	is	no	freedom	to	choose	a	different parenthesization/topology	for	that	value	computation.

What	this	does	not	guarantee: Bitwise	identical	results	across	compilers	or	platforms.	The	same	grouping	may produce	different	bits	due	to	floating-point	evaluation	model	differences.	It	also	does	not	attempt	to	standardize	the timing	or	relative	order	of	side	effects	of binary\_op beyond	what	is	required	to	compute	the	returned	value.

Contrast	with	std::reduce: std::reduce uses	a	generalized	sum	([numerics.defns]/1-2,	[reduce]/7),	allowing	the implementation	to	group	elements	as ((a	+	b)	+	(c	+	d)) or	any	other	valid	tree.	This	makes	even	the	grouping non-deterministic.

## D.2	std::ranges::fold\_left	(C++23)	(informal	paraphrase	of	the	specified	effect)

For	the	newer	Ranges-based	algorithms,	the	specification	is	even	more	explicit	about	its	algebraic	structure.

Section: [alg.fold]

[ Note: The	following	code	is	an	informal	paraphrase	for	exposition;	the	Standard	specifies	the	effect	using 'Equivalent	to:'	wording	in	[alg.fold]. -end	note ]

Paraphrase: The	range	fold	algorithms	are	sequential	left-folds.	Conceptually, ranges::fold\_left(R,	init,	f) is equivalent	to:

```
auto acc	=	init; for ( auto &&	e	:	R)	acc	=	f(std::move(acc),	e); return acc;
```

What	this	guarantees: By	defining	the	algorithm	via	an	explicit	left-fold,	the	Standard	fully	specifies	the	abstract expression	structure	(and	thus	the	returned	value).	The	accumulator	state	at	step	N	depends	exactly	and	only	on	the state	at	step	N-1	and	the	Nth	element.

## D.3	Sequential	vs.	Parallel:	Contrasting	Guarantees

| Property         | Sequential (accumulate/fold_left)   | Parallel (reduce)             |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Standard Section | [accumulate] / [alg.fold]           | [reduce]                      |
| Grouping         | Mandated: Left-to-right             | Generalized Sum (Unspecified) |
| Complexity       | O(N) operations                     | O(N) operations               |
| Evaluation Order | Fully specified                     | Not specified                 |

Key	insight: std::accumulate and std::reduce differ	in	whether	the	grouping	is	specified,	not	in	whether	they guarantee	'bitwise	reproducibility'	(neither	does,	strictly	speaking).

## D.4	Init	Placement:	Comparison	with	std::accumulate

This	proposal	specifies	init	placement	as op(I,	R) (where I is	the	initial	value	materialized	as	type A per	§4.6)	-	the initial	value	is	combined	once	at	the	end	with	the	tree	result.	The	table	below	compares	this	to std::accumulate :

| Aspect               | std::accumulate        | This Proposal ( op(I, R) )   |
|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Init handling        | Folded at every step   | Combined once at end         |
| Structure            | (((init ⊕ a) ⊕ b) ⊕ c) | init ⊕ tree_reduce(a,b,c,d)  |
| Init participates in | N operations           | 1 operation                  |

Implication	for	non-associative	operations: For	associative	operations,	these	approaches	produce	equivalent results.	For	non-associative	operations	(e.g.,	floating-point	addition),	the	results	may	differ.	Users	migrating	from std::accumulate should	be	aware	of	this	distinction.

See	Appendix	E	for	rationale	behind	the op(I,	R) design	choice.

## D.5	Important	Caveat:	Expression	Structure	≠	Bitwise	Identity

The	Standard	specifies	an	abstract	fold	expression	structure,	not	bitwise	results.	Even	when	the	grouping	of operations	is	fully	specified	(as	in std::accumulate ),	bitwise	identity	across	different	compilers,	platforms,	or	even different	runs	is	not	guaranteed	due	to:

1. Intermediate	precision: The	Standard	permits	implementations	to	use	higher	precision	for	intermediate results	(e.g.,	x87	80-bit	registers	vs	SSE	64-bit).	See	[cfenv.syn]	and	implementation-defined	floating-point behavior.
2. FMA	Contraction: A	compiler	might	contract a	*	b	+	c into	a	single	fused	multiply-add	instruction	on	one platform	but	not	another,	changing	the	result	bits.	This	is	controlled	by #pragma	STDC	FP\_CONTRACT and	compiler flags	like -ffp-contract .
3. Rounding	mode: Different	default	rounding	modes	across	implementations	can	affect	results.

What	this	proposal	provides: A	fully	specified	expression	structure	(grouping	and	operand	order).	Combined	with user	control	of	the	floating-point	evaluation	model,	this	enables	reproducibility.

What	this	proposal	does	not	provide: Automatic	cross-platform	bitwise	identity.	Users	must	also	control	their floating-point	evaluation	model	(see	§6).

## D.6	Why	Compilers	Cannot	Reassociate	Mandated	Expression	Structure

A	potential	concern	is	whether	compilers	might	reassociate	the	reduction	operations	defined	by	this	proposal, defeating	the	run-to-run	stability	guarantee.	This	section	explains	why	such	reassociation	would	be	non-conforming.

## D.6.1	The	As-If	Rule

The	C++	Standard	permits	compilers	to	perform	any	transformation	that	does	not	change	the	observable	behavior of	a	conforming	program	([intro.abstract]/1).	This	is	commonly	called	the	'as-if	rule.'

For	floating-point	arithmetic,	reassociation	(changing (a	+	b)	+	c to a	+	(b	+	c) )	generally	changes	the	result	due to	rounding.	Therefore,	a	compiler	cannot	reassociate	floating-point	operations	under	the	as-if	rule	unless:

1.  It	can	prove	the	result	is	unchanged	(generally	impossible	for	FP),	or
2.  The	user	has	explicitly	opted	into	non-standard	semantics	via	compiler	flags

## D.6.2	Existing	Precedent:	std::accumulate

std::accumulate defines	a	specific	left-fold	expression	([accumulate]/2):

'Computes	its	result	by	initializing	the	accumulator	acc	with	the	initial	value	init	and	then	modifies	it	with acc	= std::move(acc)	+	*i or acc	=	binary\_op(std::move(acc),	*i) for	every	iterator	i	in	the	range	[first,	last)	in order.'

This	wording	constrains	implementations	to	a	left-fold: (((init	⊕	a)	⊕	b)	⊕	c)	...

Compilers	respect	this	constraint.	A	compiler	that	reassociated std::accumulate into	a	tree	reduction	would	be	nonconforming,	because	the	observable	result	would	differ	for	non-associative	operations	(including	floating-point addition).

## D.6.3	This	Proposal	Follows	the	Same	Model

This	proposal	mandates	a	specific	expression	structure	with	the	same	normative	force.	The	'Generalized	Sum' semantics	of std::reduce explicitly	grant	permission	to	reassociate;	this	proposal	removes	that	permission	-	exactly as std::accumulate mandates	a	specific	left-fold	expression.

[ Note: For std::accumulate ,	the	fixed	expression	structure	also	implies	a	single	sequential	chain	of	accumulator updates.	For	this	proposal,	the	expression	structure	(parenthesization)	is	fixed,	but	independent	subexpressions	may be	evaluated	in	any	order	or	concurrently. -end	note ]

The	only	difference	from std::accumulate is	the	shape	of	the	mandated	expression:

| Algorithm       | Mandated Expression Shape                          |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| std::accumulate | (((init ⊕ a) ⊕ b) ⊕ c) Linear fold                 |
| This proposal   | init ⊕ ((a ⊕ b) ⊕ (c ⊕ d)) Pairwise reduction tree |

Both	specifications	constrain	the	parenthesization.	Both	are	subject	to	the	same	as-if	rule.	A	compiler	that reassociates	one	would	equally	violate	conformance	by	reassociating	the	other.

## D.6.4	What	About	-ffast-math?

Compiler	flags	like -ffast-math , -fassociative-math ,	or /fp:fast explicitly	opt	out	of	IEEE	754	compliance.	Under these	flags:

- The	compiler	may	reassociate	floating-point	operations
- std::accumulate may	not	produce	left-fold	results
- std::reduce may	not	match	any	particular	grouping
- This	proposal's	guarantee	would	also	not	apply

This	is	consistent	with	existing	behavior:	these	flags	override	IEEE	754	compliance	for	all	floating-point	algorithms, including std::accumulate .	Users	who	enable -ffast-math have	explicitly	traded	determinism	for	performance.

Recommendation	for	users	requiring	run-to-run	stability: Compile	with -ffp-contract=off (or	equivalent)	and avoid -ffast-math .	This	applies	equally	to std::accumulate and	to	this	proposal.

## D.6.5	Summary

| Concern                                                | Resolution                                             |
|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 'Compilers might reassociate the tree'                 | Violates as-if rule, same as for std::accumulate       |
| 'What about -ffast-math?'                              | User has opted out of IEEE 754; all FP guarantees void |
| 'Is this proposal different from existing algorithms?' | No -same conformance model as std::accumulate          |

The	expression-structure	guarantee	in	this	proposal	has	the	same	normative	force	(with	respect	to	parenthesization and	operand	order)	as	the	mandated	left-fold	structure	in std::accumulate .	Compilers	that	respect	the	latter	will respect	the	former.

## Appendix	E:	Init	Placement	Rationale	(Informative)

This	appendix	provides	rationale	for	the	init	placement	design	choice.	This	proposal	specifies Option	A:	op(I,	R) -the	initial	value	(materialized	as	a	value I of	type A per	§4.6)	is	applied	as	the	left	operand	to	the	result	of	the canonical	tree	reduction.	This	appendix	explains	why	this	option	was	chosen	over	alternatives.

[ Note: See	§4.5	(init	placement)	for	rationale. -end	note ]

## E.1	Design	Options	Considered

Option	A:	Post-reduction	( op(I,	R) )	-	CHOSEN

```
canonical_reduce<L>(E[0..N),	init,	op): if	N	==	0: return	init let	R	=	interleaved_reduce<L>(E[0..N))
```

```
let	I	=	A(init)		//	materialize	init	as	the	reduction	state	type return	op(I,	R)
```

Pros: -	init	is	not	part	of	the	canonical	reduction	tree	-	clear	separation	of	concerns	-	Simplifies	parallel implementation	(tree	can	complete	before	init	is	available)	-	Consistent	with	the	reduce	family	having	an	explicit init parameter;	this	paper	additionally	fixes	init	placement	to	a	single	final op(I,	R) to	keep	the	canonical	tree independent	of init ([reduce]).	-	Empty	range	handling	is	trivial:	return	init

Cons: -	Differs	from std::accumulate 's	left-fold	semantics	-	For	non-associative	operations,	results	differ	from	leftfold	expectations

## Option	B:	Post-reduction	(op(R,	I))

Same	as	Option	A	but	with	init	as	the	right	operand.

Pros: -	Same	implementation	simplicity	as	Option	A

Cons: -	Less	intuitive	for	users	expecting	init	to	be	'first'	-	Still	differs	from std::accumulate

## Option	C:	Treat	init	as	element	0	(prepend	to	sequence)

```
canonical_reduce<L>(E[0..N),	init,	op): let	E'	=	{init,	E[0],	E[1],	...,	E[N-1]} return	interleaved_reduce<L>(E'[0..N+1))
```

Pros: -	init	participates	in	the	canonical	tree	with	a	known	position	-	More	predictable	for	non-associative	operations

Cons: -	Shifts	all	element	indices	by	1	-	init	assigned	to	lane	0,	changing	topology	when	L	>	1	-	Complicates	the interleaving	definition

## Option	D:	Leave	implementation-defined

The	standard	specifies	that	init	participates	in	exactly	one binary\_op application	with	the	tree	result	but	does	not specify	the	order.

Pros: -	Maximum	implementation	flexibility	-	Avoids	contentious	design	decision	-	For	associative	operations	(the common	case),	result	is	unaffected

Cons: -	Non-deterministic	for	non-associative	operations	-	Users	cannot	rely	on	specific	init	behavior

## E.2	Analysis

For associative	operations (the	vast	majority	of	use	cases),	all	options	produce	equivalent	results.	The	choice	only matters	for	non-associative	operations.

For	non-associative	operations,	users	already	face	the	fact	that	the	tree	reduction	differs	from	left-fold.	The	init placement	is	one	additional	degree	of	freedom	that	must	be	specified	for	full	run-to-run	stability.

## E.3	Why	Option	A	Was	Chosen

This	proposal	specifies	Option	A	( op(I,	R) )	for	the	following	reasons:

1. SIMD	purity: Folding	init	into	lanes	would	require	broadcast	and	can	amplify	init	influence	in	non-associative operations.
2. Task	independence: A	'pure'	tree	over	the	range	can	be	computed	before	init	is	available	in	async/distributed contexts.
3. Algebraic	clarity: A	pairwise	reduction	tree	has	no	distinguished	'first'	element;	init	is	most	naturally	a	postreduction	adjustment.
4. Precedent: This	is	consistent	with	the	reduce	family	having	an	explicit init parameter;	this	paper	additionally fixes	init	placement	to	a	single	final op(I,	R) to	keep	the	canonical	tree	independent	of init ([reduce]).
5. Full	determinism: Specifying	the	placement	ensures	that	the	complete	abstract	expression	-	including	init placement	-	is	fully	determined.	(The	evaluation	order	of	independent	subexpressions	remains	unspecified.)

## E.4	Why	Not	Treat	init	as	Element	0?

Treating	init	as	'element	0'	(Option	C)	introduces	complications:

- With	L	>	1,	init	would	be	assigned	to	lane	0,	but	all	other	element	indices	would	shift
- The	meaning	of	init	would	depend	on	lane	topology	in	ways	that	are	harder	to	explain	and	reason	about
- It	conflates	two	distinct	roles:	'initial	state'	vs	'operand	in	the	tree'

The	post-reduction	design	keeps	these	roles	separate.

## E.5	Migration	Path	for	Users	Expecting	accumulate-style	Semantics

Users	who	require	init	to	participate	as	a	leaf	within	the	tree	(rather	than	post-reduction)	can	achieve	this	through composition:

```
//	To	get	init	as	element	0	in	the	tree: auto extended	=	concat_view(single_view(init),	data); auto result	=	canonical_reduce<L>(extended.begin(),	extended.end(), identity_element,	op); //	Or	manually: auto tree_result	=	canonical_reduce<L>(data.begin(),	data.end(), identity_element,	op); auto result	=	op(init,	tree_result); //	explicit	post-reduction	(matches	this	proposal)
```

This	flexibility	allows	users	to	achieve	alternative	semantics	when	needed	while	the	standard	provides	a	single,	welldefined	default.

## Appendix	F:	Design	Evolution	(Informative)

This	proposal	underwent	significant	internal	development	before	committee	submission.	The	design	space	was explored	systematically,	with	key	decisions	documented	in	§3	(Design	Space)	and	the	appendices.	This	section summarizes	the	major	evolution	points	for	reviewers	interested	in	the	design	rationale.

## F.2	Key	Design	Iterations

Why	lane	count	(L): The	lane	count L is	the	semantic	topology	coordinate.	It	directly	determines	the	abstract expression	tree	structure.	Earlier	designs	also	considered	a	byte-span	parameter M ,	but	this	was	rejected	due	to	the portability	trap	described	in	§9.2: sizeof(value\_type) varies	across	platforms,	so	the	same M value	would	silently produce	different	expressions	on	different	targets.

Why	interleaved,	not	blocked: Blocked	decomposition	creates	topology	that	varies	with	thread	count	and alignment.	Interleaved	assignment	(index	mod	L)	produces	stable	topology	regardless	of	execution	strategy.	See §3.2.

Why	user-specified	L: Fixed	L	ages	poorly	as	hardware	evolves;	implementation-defined	L	does	not	provide determinism.	User	specification	places	control	where	it	belongs.	See	§3.3.

Init	placement: Treating	init	as	'element	0'	would	shift	all	indices	and	change	lane	assignment.	Post-reduction application	keeps	the	tree	'pure'	and	is	compatible	with	the	reduce-family	API	shape	(explicit init ),	while additionally	specifying	a	fixed	init	placement	([reduce]).	See	§4.5	and	Appendix	E.

## F.3	Industry	Context

The	core	design	(fixed	topology,	user-controlled	width)	draws	on	approaches	seen	in	production	libraries:	-	Intel oneMKL	CNR	(Conditional	Numerical	Reproducibility)	-	NVIDIA	CUB	deterministic	overloads	-	PyTorch/TensorFlow deterministic	modes

These	libraries	address	similar	problems	through	different	mechanisms.	Their	existence	suggests	the	design	space is	viable	and	addresses	real	needs.	See	§3.6	for	references.

## Appendix	G:	Detailed	Design	Rationale	(Informative)

This	appendix	has	detailed	rationale	for	design	decisions	that	were	summarized	in	Section	4.	It	is	provided	for reviewers	seeking	deeper	understanding	of	the	trade-offs.

## G.1	Lane	Count	and	Hardware	Alignment

The	lane	count L is	specified	directly,	making	the	topology	explicit	and	portable.	Users	who	wish	to	align	with hardware	SIMD	width	can	compute L at	the	call	site	(e.g., 64	/	sizeof(V) ).	This	is	a	performance	heuristic	only;	for cross-target	expression	identity	choose	the	same	explicit L across	platforms.	The	following	tables	show	how	common L values	relate	to	hardware	targets:

|   L | double (8B)   | float (4B)   | int32_t (4B)   | Register width    |
|-----|---------------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
|   2 | 16 bytes      | 8 bytes      | 8 bytes        | SSE/NEON (double) |

Implementations	with	narrower	physical	registers	execute	the	canonical	expression	through	multiple	iterations.	The logical	topology	-	which	operations	combine	with	which	-	is	unchanged.

## G.2	Why	Interleaved	Topology	Supports	Efficient	SIMD

The	interleaved	topology	supports	the	simplest	and	most	efficient	SIMD	implementation	pattern:

```
Memory:	E[0]	E[1]	E[2]	E[3]	|	E[4]	E[5]	E[6]	E[7]	|	E[8]	... └───	Vector	0	────┘		└───	Vector	1	────┘ Iteration	1:	Load	V0	=	{E[0],	E[1],	E[2],	E[3]}	→	Acc	=	V0 Iteration	2:	Load	V1	=	{E[4],	E[5],	E[6],	E[7]}	→	Acc	=	Acc	+	V1 ... Final:	Acc	=	{R_0,	R_1,	R_2,	R_3}
```

This	pattern	achieves:	-	One	contiguous	vector	load	per	iteration	(optimal	memory	access)	-	One	vector	add	per iteration	(single	instruction)	-	Streaming	sequential	access	(spatially	local)	-	No	shuffles	or	gathers	until	final horizontal	reduction

A	blocked	topology	would	require	gather	operations	or	sequential	per-lane	processing,	losing	the	SIMD	benefit.

## G.3	Information	Density	and	Spatial	Locality

When L is	chosen	to	match	the	target	SIMD	width	(e.g., L	=	8 for	AVX-512	with double ),	the	algorithm	maintains exactly L independent	partial-accumulator	lanes	per	logical	stride,	which	maps	directly	to	register-width	execution.

For	any	type,	specifying L	=	1 degenerates	to	a	single-lane	canonical	pairwise	reduction	tree	with	perfect	spatial locality.

## G.4	Cross-Architecture	Expression-Parity

GPU	architectures	achieve	peak	efficiency	when	reduction	trees	align	with	warp	width	(typically	32	threads).	For double	(8	bytes),	a	warp-level	reduction	operates	on	32	×	8	=	256	bytes.

By	specifying	L=32,	users	define	a	canonical	expression	that	maps	to	warp-level	operations	on	GPU	while	CPU evaluates	the	same	mathematical	expression	by	iterating	over	narrower	registers.

What	expression-parity	guarantees: All	platforms	evaluate	the	same	mathematical	expression	-	same parenthesization,	same	operand	ordering,	same	reduction	tree	topology.

What	it	does	not	guarantee: Bitwise	reproducibility	requires	equivalent	floating-point	semantics	across architectures,	which	is	difficult	due	to	differences	in	FTZ/DAZ	modes,	FMA	contraction,	and	rounding	behavior.

## G.5	The	Golden	Reference	(L	=	1)

Specifying L	=	1 collapses	the	algorithm	to	a	single	global	pairwise	reduction	tree.	This	serves	as	a	hardwareagnostic	baseline	for	CI/CD	testing	and	debugging	numerical	discrepancies.

## G.6	Divergence	from	std::accumulate

std::accumulate specifies	a	strict	linear	left-fold	with	depth	O(N). canonical\_reduce specifies	a	pairwise	reduction tree	with	depth	O(log	N).	For	non-associative	operations,	these	are	different	algebraic	expressions	and	may	produce different	results.

For	floating-point	summation,	the	tree	structure	is	often	numerically	advantageous:	error	growth	is	O(log	N	·	ε) versus	O(N	·	ε)	for	left-fold.	This	is	well-established	as	'pairwise	summation'	in	numerical	analysis	[Higham2002].

## G.7	Init	Placement	Determinism

If	init	placement	were	implementation-defined,	two	conforming	implementations	could	produce	different	results	for the	same	inputs.	For	non-commutative	operations:

```
op(I,	R)	=	5.0	*	2	+	10.0	=	20.0 op(R,	I)	=	10.0	*	2	+	5.0	=	25.0
```

Therefore,	this	proposal	normatively	specifies op(I,	R) -	init	as	left	operand	of	the	final	combination.

## Appendix	H:	Performance	Feasibility	(Informative)

This	appendix	provides	representative	prototype	measurements	to	support	the	claim	that	enforcing	a	fixed expression	structure	is	practical.	These	measurements	are	not	a	performance	guarantee.

## H.1	Prototype	test	conditions

- Floating-point	evaluation	model	controls: -ffp-contract=off , -fno-fast-math (GCC/Clang); /fp:precise (MSVC)
- FMA	explicitly	disabled via	compiler	flags	where	applicable
- Input	sizes: 10K	to	10M	elements,	uniformly	distributed	random	values

## H.2	Representative	observations

- Observed	overhead	of	approximately	10-15%	compared	to std::reduce for	typical	inputs	in	the	tested configurations.
- Overhead	is	primarily	attributable	to	enforcing	a	fixed	parenthesization	(removing	reassociation	freedom)	and maintaining	per-lane	state.
- Results	are	configuration-dependent;	different	compilers,	CPUs/ISAs,	and	choices	of	L	can	shift	the	trade-off materially.
- [Note:*	These	figures	reflect	a	baseline	prototype.	The	SIMD-optimised	implementation	in	Appendix	N	(SIMD optimization	section)	demonstrates	throughput	competitive	with	or	exceeding std::reduce on	the	same hardware,	indicating	that	the	overhead	is	an	artefact	of	the	unoptimised	prototype	rather	than	an	inherent	cost of	the	canonical	semantics.	*-end	note]

## H.3	Interpretation

Users	opt	into	a	canonical	reduction	when	they	value	reproducibility	and	auditability	over	peak	throughput.	Users requiring	maximum	throughput	can	continue	to	use std::reduce (or	domain-specific	facilities)	where	unspecified reassociation	is	acceptable.

## Appendix	I:	Rationale	for	Lane	Count	Presets	(Informative)

This	appendix	records	rationale	for	providing	a	small	set	of standard-fixed	lane	count	preset	constants as coordination	points	for	topology	selection	(§9.6).	The	goal	is	to	provide	readable,	stable	choices	that	do	not	vary	with platform	properties,	value	type,	or	ABI,	and	therefore	avoid	'silent	semantic	drift'	in	returned	values	for	non-

associative	operations.

The	lane	count L is	the	semantic	topology	coordinate.	Because L is	specified	directly	(not	derived	from	a	byte	span	see	§9.2),	the	same	preset	selects	the	same	abstract	expression	regardless	of sizeof(value\_type) .

## I.1	Rationale	for	L	=	16	(Narrow	Preset)

A	'narrow'	preset	should	provide	useful	parallelism	for	the	most	common	scalar	sizes	while	staying	small	enough that	overhead	does	not	dominate	for	moderate	N.

L	=	16	is	a	practical	coordination	point	because:	-	It	matches	AVX-512	lane	count	for float (16	×	4	bytes	=	64	bytes =	one	ZMM	register).	-	It	provides	2×	AVX-512	width	for double (16	×	8	bytes	=	128	bytes),	which	maps	to	tworegister	unrolling	-	a	standard	SIMD	optimization	pattern.	-	It	is	a	power	of	two,	ensuring	the	per-lane	tree	is perfectly	balanced	for	power-of-two	K	values.	-	It	is	wide	enough	for	meaningful	instruction-level	parallelism	on	all current	architectures	yet	narrow	enough	that	the	cross-lane	Stage	2	tree	is	shallow	(4	levels).

## I.2	Rationale	for	L	=	128	(Wide	Preset)

A	'wide'	preset	is	an	explicit	opt-in	for	throughput-oriented	structures	and	heterogeneous	verification	workflows.

L	=	128	provides	substantial	independent	work	per	lane	and	can	support	aggressive	batching	and	parallel evaluation	of	independent	reduction	nodes	while	preserving	the	same	abstract	expression.	It	accommodates	GPU warp	widths	(32)	with	room	for	multi-warp	cooperation	and	enables	deeply	unrolled	SIMD	loops	on	CPU.

## I.3	Cross-Domain	Verification

Because	these	presets	are	standard-fixed	lane	counts,	a	user	can	select	the	same	preset	when	executing	on	different hardware	or	in	different	deployment	environments.	When	the	floating-point	evaluation	model	is	aligned	(and	the same binary\_op and	input	order	are	used),	the	abstract	expression	structure	is	identical;	any	remaining	divergence is	attributable	to	differences	in	the	underlying	arithmetic	environment	rather	than	to	reassociation	or	topology choice.

[ Note: This	appendix	is	informative.	These	values	are	coordination	points	for	a	stable	abstract	expression;	they	do not	impose	any	particular	scheduling,	threading,	or	vectorization	strategy. -end	note ]

## Appendix	J:	Indicative	API	Straw	Man	(Informative)

This	appendix	is	illustrative;	no	API	is	proposed	in	this	paper	(§2).	It	records	one	indicative	way	an	eventual Standard	Library	facility	could	expose	the	semantics	defined	in	§4,	while	adopting	the	standard-fixed	named	preset approach	(Option	3	in	§9.5).	The	intent	is	to	give	LEWG	something	concrete	to	react	to,	while	keeping	spelling	and header	placement	explicitly	provisional.	Sender-returning	(P2300)	surfaces	are	deferred	to	the	follow-on	API	paper.

Presentation	note	(informative): -	The semantic	topology	coordinate is	the	lane	count L .	-	The	lane	count L is the	sole	semantic	topology	coordinate.	The	canonical	expression	is	fully	determined	by (N,	L) .	-	When	crossplatform	expression	stability	is	needed, L must	be	specified	directly	(not	derived	from	hardware	properties).

## J.1	Design	goal

- Preserve	the	core	semantic	contract:	for	fixed	topology	selection,	the	returned	value	is	as-if	evaluating	the canonical	expression.
- Avoid	'silent	semantic	drift'	for	a	no-argument	default:	defaults	must	be	stable	across	targets/toolchains.
- Make	'coordination	choices'	readable:	users	should	be	able	to	say	'narrow	/	wide'	in	code	reviews,	not	'16	/ 128'.

## J.2	Favored	approach:	standard-fixed	preset	constants	(Option	3)

This	approach	exposes	preset	names	as	standard-fixed	constants	for	lane	count L ,	and	(optionally)	defines	a	default in	terms	of	one	of	those	preset	constants.

## Illustrative	(provisional)	names:

Placement	in namespace	std is	illustrative	only;	a	follow-on	API	paper	may	place	any	such	presets	in	a	dedicated scope	(e.g.,	a	nested	namespace	or	tag	type)	to	avoid	adding	new	top-level std names.

```
namespace std	{ //	Standard-fixed	lane	presets.	Values	never	change. inline constexpr size_t	canonical_lanes_narrow	=	16; //	baseline	lane	preset inline constexpr size_t	canonical_lanes_wide	=	128; //	wide	lane	preset //	This	paper	does	not	propose	a	default.	A	follow-on	API	paper	may	propose	one. }
```

Clarification	(informative): The	preset	lane	values	above	are	intended	to	be	fixed, constexpr constants,	not implementation-tunable	parameters,	so	that	the	same	canonical	expression	shape	is	selected	across implementations.	This	does	not	imply	bitwise-identical	results	across	different	floating-point	evaluation	models.

## J.3	Straw-man	algorithm	API

The	simplest	surface	is	an	algorithm	family	parameterized	by	lane	count L .

```
namespace std	{ template <size_t	L, class InputIterator, class T, class BinaryOperation> constexpr T	canonical_reduce(InputIterator	first,	InputIterator	last, T	init,	BinaryOperation	binary_op); template <size_t	L, class ExecutionPolicy, class ForwardIterator, class T, class BinaryOperation> T	canonical_reduce(ExecutionPolicy&&	policy, ForwardIterator	first,	ForwardIterator	last, T	init,	BinaryOperation	binary_op); }
```

## Typical	call	sites:

```
//	Readable	coordination	points	(narrow	vs	wide) auto a	=	std::canonical_reduce<std::canonical_lanes_narrow>(v.begin(),	v.end(),	0.0,	std::plus<>{}); auto b	=	std::canonical_reduce<std::canonical_lanes_wide>(v.begin(),	v.end(),	0.0,	std::plus<>{}); //	Explicit	literal	for	hardware-specific	alignment auto c	=	std::canonical_reduce<8>(v.begin(),	v.end(),	0.0,	std::plus<>{}); //	L	=	8
```

Rationale	for	this	shape	(informative): -	Keeps	the	topology	selection	in	the	type	system	(NTTP),	which	is consistent	with	'semantic	selection',	not	a	performance	hint.	-	Supports	compile-time	specialization	for	a	fixed topology	coordinate	without	requiring	new	execution-policy	machinery.	-	Makes	the	coordination	presets	show	up	in diagnostics	and	in	code	review	as	names.	-	For	fixed L ,	the	canonical	tree	is	identical	across	all	targets,	even	if sizeof(V) differs.

## J.4	Notes	on	naming	and	evolution

- The	values	of	existing	preset	constants	must	never	change.	Future	standards	may	add	new	presets	under	new names.
- Whether	the	facility	lives	as	a	new	algorithm	(e.g., canonical\_reduce )	or	as	a std::reduce -adjacent	customization is	an	LEWG	design	choice;	this	appendix	only	shows	one	straightforward	spelling.
- If	LEWG	prefers	to	mirror	[numerics.defns]	('GENERALIZED\_SUM'-style	definitional	functions),	the	same	preset constants	can	still	be	used	as	stable	topology	selectors.

[ Note: This	appendix	is	illustrative.	It	is	intended	to	reduce	'API	haze'	during	discussion	while	keeping	the	semantic core	of	the	paper	independent	of	any	particular	surface	spelling. -end	note ]

## J.5	Range	overloads	(straw-man)

Range	overloads	are	deferred	per	§2.	The	following	sketches	are	included	only	to	reduce	'API	haze'	and	to	indicate one	illustrative	direction	consistent	with	the	semantic	requirements	of	§4.

Key	observation: the	canonical	expression	in	§4	is	defined	over	N	elements,	so	a	range	surface	generally	needs	N prior	to	evaluation.	A	surface	can	obtain	N	without	allocation	(e.g., sized\_range or	a	counting	pass	over	a	multipass range),	or	it	can	require	explicit	materialization	for	single-pass	sources.

```
namespace std::ranges	{ //	Lane	coordinate	-	sequential/reference	mode //	Non-sized	forward	ranges	can	be	supported	via	a	counting	pass	to	determine	N. template <size_t	L, forward_range	R, class T, class BinaryOperation> requires (L	>=	1) constexpr T	canonical_reduce(R&&	r,	T	init,	BinaryOperation	op); //	Lane	coordinate	-	execution	policy	overload	(illustrative,	conservative	constraints) template <size_t	L, class ExecutionPolicy, random_access_range	R, class T, class BinaryOperation> requires sized_range<R>	&& is_execution_policy_v<remove_cvref_t<ExecutionPolicy>>	&& (L	>=	1) T	canonical_reduce(ExecutionPolicy&&	policy,	R&&	r,	T	init,	BinaryOperation	op); }
```

[ Note: The	final	constraints	for	a	range	surface	(e.g.,	whether	to	permit	a	counting	pass	for	non-sized	multipass ranges,	and	whether	to	reject	single-pass input\_range to	avoid	implicit	allocation)	are	design	questions	for	a subsequent	API-focused	revision	once	LEWG	has	accepted	the	semantic	contract	in	§4.	Appendix	L	records	the relevant	trade-offs. -end	note ]

## Appendix	K:	Demonstrator	Godbolts	(Informative)

This	appendix	is	not	part	of	the	proposal.	It	records	the	demonstrator	Compiler	Explorer	('Godbolt')	programs	used to	validate	the	semantics	described	in	§4	on	multiple	architectures,	and	to	show	the	gross	performance	impact	of enforcing	a	fixed	abstract	expression.

The	programs	referenced	here	are	semantic	witnesses ,	not	reference	implementations.	They	exist	to demonstrate	that	the	canonical	expression	defined	in	§4	can	be	evaluated	on	real	hardware	(SIMD,	GPU,	multithreaded).	They	are	not	normative	examples	and	are	not	intended	as	implementation	guidance	for	general binary\_op .	All	demonstrators	except	GB-SEQ	test	only std::plus<double> and	may	use 0.0 for	absent	operand positions;	conforming	implementations	must	handle	arbitrary binary\_op via	the	lifted COMBINE rules	of	§4.2.2.

## §K.0	Golden	reference	values

The	following	reference	results	are	used	throughout	the	demonstrators	to	validate	bitwise	reproducibility	under	the specified	canonical	expression	and	fixed	PRNG	seed:

```
NARROW ( L	=	16 ): 0x40618f71f6379380 WIDE ( L	=	128 ): 0x40618f71f6379397
```

[ Note: These	values	validate	conformance	to	the	canonical	expression	for	the	specific	demonstrator	environment. Bitwise	agreement	across	platforms	additionally	requires	aligned	floating-point	evaluation	models	(§2.5,	§6). -end note ]

The	intent	is	pragmatic:	give	reviewers	a	'click-run-inspect'	artifact	that:	-	validates	semantic	invariants	(tree identity	and	'golden	hex'	outputs)	rather	than	trying	to	'win	benchmarks',	-	prints	a	short	verification	block	(seed, N,	and	the	resulting	hex	value),	-	checks	run-to-run	stability	and	translational	invariance	(address-offset	invariance), -	and	shows	a	coarse	benchmark	table	comparing	against std::accumulate and std::reduce variants.

Important	caveat: Compiler	Explorer	run	times	vary	substantially	with	VM	load,	CPU	model,	and	throttling.	These tables	are	illustrative	only;	the	repository	benchmarks	(multi-thread	and	CUDA)	are	the	authoritative	numbers.

## K.1	Demonstrator	set	(gross	platform	runs)

The	following	Compiler	Explorer	('Godbolt')	demonstrators	are	intended	to	be	click-run-inspect	artifacts	for reviewers.	Each	link	has:	-	a	determinism/verification	block	(seed,	N,	and	printed	result	hex),	-	run-to-run	stability checks,	-	a	coarse	timing	table	comparing	against std::accumulate and std::reduce variants	under	comparable	FP settings.

Hostile	data	generators	([GB-x86-MT-EXT]): The	extended	correctness	demonstrator	uses	five	data	generators chosen	to	be	maximally	sensitive	to	grouping	order.

All	demonstrators	use	the	same	dataset	generation	(seeded	RNG)	and	report	the	same	canonical	results	for	the	two topology	coordinates	used	throughout	this	paper:

- Small	/	narrow: L	=	16	for	double
- Large	/	wide: L	=	128	for	double

## K.2	What	the	demonstrators	are	intended	to	prove

Each	demonstrator	prints:

1. Data	verification: the	first	few	generated	elements	(as	hex)	match	a	known	sequence	for	the	fixed	seed.
2. Correctness: the	returned	value	for	L=16	and	L=128	matches	known	'golden'	hex	outputs.
3. Run-to-run	stability: repeated	evaluation	yields	identical	results.
4. Translational	invariance: copying	the	same	values	to	different	memory	offsets	does	not	change	the	result.

These	are	concrete	checks	that:	-	the	canonical	expression	is	independent	of	execution	schedule	(single-thread	vs vectorized),	-	the	topology	is	a	function	of	the	chosen	lane	count L and	input	order,	-	and	the	implementation	does not	accidentally	depend	on	address	alignment	or	allocator	behavior.

## K.3	Expected	verification	outputs	(for	the	published	demonstrators)

For	the	canonical	seed	and	N	=	1,000,000	doubles,	the	demonstrators	are	configured	to	print	the	following	expected result	hex	values:

- L	=	16,	'NARROW': 0x40618f71f6379380
- L	=	128,	'WIDE': 0x40618f71f6379397

The	demonstrators	treat	a	mismatch	as	a	test	failure.

## K.3.1	Cancellation	stress	dataset	(recommended)

The	PRNG	dataset	validates	implementation	correctness	but	may	not	demonstrate why canonical	reduction	matters. Uniform	random	values	of	similar	size	can	produce	nearly	identical	results	under	different	tree	shapes,	making	the golden	match	appear	trivially	achievable.

To	demonstrate	the	facility's	core	value	proposition,	demonstrators	should	additionally	include	a cancellationheavy	dataset where	evaluation	order	visibly	affects	the	result.	The	pattern	from	§1.2,	scaled	to	large	N:

```
//	Cancellation	stress:	[+1e16,	+1.0,	-1e16,	+1.0,	...]	repeated	N/4	times std::vector<double>	data; for (size_t	i	=	0;	i	<	N/4;	++i)	{ data.push_back(+1e16); data.push_back(+1.0); data.push_back(-1e16); data.push_back(+1.0); }
```

For	this	dataset,	the	demonstrators	should	show	all	three	of:

1. std::reduce is	non-deterministic: repeated	runs	(or	varying	thread	counts)	produce	different	hex	values, because	the	scheduler	changes	the	effective	parenthesization.
2. canonical\_reduce with	fixed L is	deterministic: repeated	runs	produce	identical	hex	values,	because	the	tree	is fixed.
3. Different L values	produce	different	results: confirming	that	the	topology	coordinate	controls	the	abstract expression	and	is	not	an	implementation	hint.

This	triple	is	the	paper's	entire	motivation	in	one	test	output.	If	the	PRNG	dataset	is	the	'does	the	implementation work?'	test,	the	cancellation	dataset	is	the	'does	the	facility	matter?'	test.

If std::execution::par is	unavailable	or	unreliable	in	the	CE	environment,	the	demonstrator	can	be	built	with:

-DNO\_PAR\_POLICIES=1

## K.5	Interpreting	the	performance	tables	(gross	impacts)

The	demonstrators	typically	report:	std::accumulate as	a	deterministic,	sequential	baseline;	std::reduce variants (no	policy,	seq,	unseq,	and	optionally	par*)	as	'existing	practice'	comparators;	-	deterministic/canonical	narrow	and wide	presets.

Readers	should	interpret	the	results	as:	Gross	cost	of	structure: overhead	(or	sometimes	speedup)	relative	to std::reduce(seq) under	similar	FP	settings.	Configuration	sensitivity: narrow	vs	wide	presets	can	trade	off cache	behavior,	vectorization,	and	bandwidth.	Non-authoritative: results	on	CE	do	not	replace	proper benchmarking;	they	are	a	convenience	for	quick	inspection.

## K.6	Relationship	to	repository	evidence

The	accompanying	repository	(referenced	in	the	paper's	artifacts	section)	contains:	-	controlled	micro-benchmarks on	pinned	CPUs	(repeatable	measurements),	-	multi-threaded	execution	model	comparisons,	-	and	a	CUDA demonstrator	evaluating	the	same	canonical	expression	(for	chosen	topology)	to	support	heterogeneous	'golden

result'	workflows.

[ Note: These	demonstrators	depend	on	specific	compiler	versions	and	Compiler	Explorer	VM	configurations available	at	the	time	of	writing.	The	normative	specification	is	§4;	demonstrator	links	provide	supplementary illustration	only.	If	a	link	becomes	unavailable	or	produces	results	inconsistent	with	the	published	golden	values	due to	toolchain	changes,	the	specification	remains	unaffected. -end	note ]

## Appendix	L:	Ranges	Compatibility	(Informative)

This	appendix	is	not	part	of	the	proposal.	It	records	design	considerations	for	eventual	C++20/23	ranges	overloads that	expose	the	semantics	of	§4	in	a	composable	way.

## L.1	A	range	surface	does	not	change	the	semantic	contract

A	range-based	surface	would	not	change	the	semantic	contract:	for	a	fixed	lane	count L ,	input	order,	and binary\_op , the	returned	value	is	as-if	evaluating	the	canonical	expression	defined	in	§4.

This	paper	intentionally	defers	the	ranges	surface	to	keep	first	discussion	focused	on	the	semantic	contract	(see	§2). Appendix	J.5	contains	a	straw-man	sketch.

## L.2	Determining	N	without	hidden	allocation

The	canonical	expression	in	§4	is	defined	over	N	elements	in	a	fixed	input	order.	A	range-based	surface	therefore needs	a	way	to	determine	N	and	to	preserve	the	element	order	used	by	the	expression.

Three	implementation	strategies	exist:

- sized\_range: obtain	N	in	O(1)	via ranges::size(r) .
- Non-sized,	multipass	(forward\_range): determine	N	via	a	counting	pass	(e.g., ranges::distance(r) ),	then evaluate	the	canonical	expression	in	a	second	pass.	This	avoids	allocation	but	may	traverse	the	range	twice.
- Single-pass	(input\_range): the	count	is	not	available	without	consuming	the	range.	However,	the	iterative pairwise	(shift-reduce)	evaluation	strategy	can	consume	elements	in	a	single	pass,	discovering N at	end-ofsequence	and	completing	the	canonical	tree	at	that	point.	Whether	an	API	surface	accepts input\_range directly	is an	API	decision	deferred	to	a	subsequent	revision.

One	conservative	design	point	(for	a	subsequent	API	revision)	is	to	avoid	implicit	allocation:

- Sequential/reference	overloads: accept forward\_range and	permit	a	counting	pass	when	N	is	not	otherwise known.
- Execution-policy	overloads: require	a	stronger	range	category	(e.g., random\_access\_range )	and	may	also require sized\_range ,	keeping	buffering	explicit.

## L.3	Working	with	non-sized,	single-pass	sources

For	sources	that	are	single-pass	(or	otherwise	cannot	be	traversed	twice),	users	requiring	canonical	reduction	can materialize	explicitly:

```
auto filtered	=	data |	std::views::filter(pred) |	std::ranges::to<std::vector>(); auto r	=	std::ranges::canonical_reduce<std::canonical_lanes_narrow>( filtered, 0.0, std::plus<>{});
```

This	makes	allocation	explicit	and	keeps	the	cost	model	under	user	control.

## L.4	Projection	parameter

This	paper	does	not	attempt	to	design	a	projection	parameter.	Users	can	express	projection	by	composing	with views::transform ,	keeping	the	algorithm	surface	orthogonal	and	consistent	with	ranges	composition:

```
auto sum	=	std::ranges::canonical_reduce<std::canonical_lanes_narrow>( data	|	std::views::transform([](const auto &	x)	{ return x.value;	}), 0.0, std::plus<>{});
```

[ Note: This	appendix	is	informative.	It	does	not	commit	the	proposal	to	a	particular	ranges	overload	set;	it documents	constraints	and	trade-offs	to	inform	a	subsequent	API-focused	revision. -end	note ]

## Appendix	M:	Detailed	Motivation	and	Use	Cases	(Informative)

This	appendix	is	not	part	of	the	proposal.	It	collects	the	longer	use-case	narratives	(with	examples)	to	keep	the	main document	focused	on	the	semantic	contract	in	§4.

The	following	use	cases	illustrate	the	value	of	run-to-run	stable	parallel	reduction.

[ Note: Code	examples	use	a	placeholder	spelling.	No	specific	API	is	proposed	in	this	paper. -end	note ]

## M.1	CI	Regression	Testing

```
//	Test	that	fails	intermittently	with	std::reduce double	baseline	=	load_golden_value("gradient_sum.bin"); //	Previously	computed double	computed	=	std::reduce(std::execution::par, gradients.begin(),	gradients.end(),	0.0); EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(baseline,	computed); //	FAILS:	result	varies	by	thread	scheduling //	With	canonical_reduce:	no	run-to-run	variation double	computed	=	canonical_reduce<8>( //	L	=	8 gradients.begin(),	gradients.end(),	0.0); EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(baseline,	computed); //	PASSES:	expression	structure	is	fixed //	(baseline	must	also	have	been	computed	with	same	L	on	same	platform)
```

Value: Eliminate	spurious	test	failures	caused	by	run-to-run	variation	from	unspecified	reduction	order.	Within	a consistent	build/test	environment,	the	returned	value	is	stable	across	invocations.

## M.2	Distributed	Training	Checkpoints

```
//	Machine	learning	gradient	aggregation //	Expression	structure	fixed	by	the	chosen	lane	count	L,	enabling	reproducible	checkpoints auto gradient_sum	=	canonical_reduce<8>( local_gradients.begin(),	local_gradients.end(),	0.0); //	Later,	on	same	or	equivalent	hardware: auto restored_sum	=	canonical_reduce<8>( restored_gradients.begin(),	restored_gradients.end(),	0.0); //	Reproducible:	same	inputs	+	same	L	+	the	same	floating-point	evaluation	model	→	same	result //	No	longer	subject	to	thread-count	or	scheduling	variation
```

Value: Enable	checkpoint/restore	with	reproducible	gradient	aggregation,	eliminating	run-to-run	variation	from unspecified	reduction	order.	Cross-platform	restore	requires	matching	floating-point	semantics.

## M.3	Scientific	Reproducibility

```
//	Climate	model	energy	conservation	check //	Paper	claims:	"Energy	drift	<	1e-12	per	century" //	Reviewers	must	reproduce	this	result auto total	=	canonical_reduce<8>( grid_cells.begin(),	grid_cells.end(), Cell{0.0,	0.0}, [](const	Cell&	a,	const	Cell&	b)	{ return Cell{a.kinetic	+	b.kinetic,	a.potential	+	b.potential}; }); double	total_energy	=	total.kinetic	+	total.potential; //	Published	with:	"Results	computed	with	L=8,	compiled	with	-ffp-contract=off" //	Reviewer	with	the	same	L	and	evaluation-model	settings	gets	same	result
```

Value: Enable	peer	verification	of	published	computational	results	when	floating-point	evaluation	model	is documented	and	matched.

## M.4	Exascale	HPC	with	Kokkos

```
//	DOE	exascale	application	using	Kokkos //	Kokkos	guarantees	same-config	reproducibility,	but	results	may	differ //	across	thread	counts,	backends,	or	architectures //	In	such	cases,	results	can	vary	across	runs,	complicating	debugging	and	reproducibility Kokkos::parallel_reduce("EnergySum",	N,	KOKKOS_LAMBDA(int	i,	double&	sum)	{ sum	+=	compute_energy(i); },	total_energy); //	With	standardized	canonical	reduction	semantics,	frameworks	could	expose	a	canonical	mode //	(illustrative	-	actual	Kokkos	API	would	be	determined	by	Kokkos	maintainers) Kokkos::parallel_reduce<Kokkos::CanonicalLanes<8>>("EnergySum",	N,	KOKKOS_LAMBDA(int	i,	double&	sum)	{ sum	+=	compute_energy(i); },	total_energy); //	Reproducible	across	runs	on	same	platform //	Cross-platform	reproducibility	requires	matching	FP	semantics
```

Value: Enable	reproducible	physics	in	production	HPC	codes,	at	least	within	a	consistent	execution	environment.

## M.5	Cross-Platform	Development

```
//	Game	physics:	aim	for	consistency	between	client	platforms constexpr size_t	PHYSICS_L	=	16; //	16	lanes float	compute_collision_impulse(const	std::vector<Contact>&	contacts)	{ auto total	=	canonical_reduce<PHYSICS_L>( contacts.begin(),	contacts.end(), Contact{0.0f}, [](const	Contact&	a,	const	Contact&	b)	{ return Contact{a.impulse	+	b.impulse}; }); return total.impulse; } //	Expression	structure	is	fixed. //	Cross-platform	match	requires	controlling	floating-point	evaluation	model //	(e.g.,	disabling	FMA,	matching	rounding	modes)
```

Value: Fix	expression	structure	as	one	component	of	cross-platform	consistency.	Full	cross-platform	bitwise	identity additionally	requires	matching	hardware-level	FP	behaviors	(e.g.,	contraction,	intermediate	precision,	and subnormal	handling),	which	are	outside	the	scope	of	this	proposal.

## M.6	Reference	and	Debugging	Mode

A	practical	requirement	for	reproducibility	is	the	ability	to	validate	and	debug	operator	logic	on	a	single	thread while	preserving	the	same	abstract	expression	as	production	parallel	execution.	For	that	reason,	if	an	eventual Standard	Library	API	is	adopted,	the	overload	without	an	ExecutionPolicy	should	be	specified	to	evaluate	the identical	canonical	expression	tree	as	the	execution-policy	overloads	for	the	same	L	and	inputs.

This	'reference	mode'	enables:	-	Reproducing	'golden	results'	for	audit	or	regression	testing	on	a	single	thread,	Debugging binary\_op with	conventional	tools	while	guaranteeing	expression-equivalence	to	the	parallel	workload,	Cross-platform	verification	(e.g.,	CPU	verification	of	accelerator-produced	results)	when	evaluation	models	are aligned.

[ Note: This	paper	does	not	propose	a	specific	API	shape;	this	subsection	records	a	design	requirement	that	follows from	the	semantic	goal. -end	note ]

## Appendix	N:	Multi-Threaded	Implementation	via	Ordered	State	Merge (Informative)

This	appendix	describes	a	multi-threaded	implementation	strategy	that	achieves	parallel	execution	while	preserving equality	with	the	single-threaded	canonical	expression	(bitwise	identity	under	the	same	floating-point	evaluation environment;	see	§6).	A	reference	implementation	is	available	at [GB-x86-MT] .

## N.1	Overview

The	single-threaded	shift-reduce	algorithm	(§4.2)	processes	blocks	sequentially,	maintaining	a	binary-counter	stack that	implicitly	encodes	the	canonical	pairwise	tree.	To	parallelize	this	while	preserving	determinism,	we	observe that:

1.  The	stack	state	after	processing	any	prefix	of	blocks	is	a	complete	representation	of	that	prefix's	reduction
2.  Two	stack	states	can	be	merged	to	produce	the	state	that	would	result	from	processing	their	blocks	sequentially
3.  Power-of-2	aligned	partition	boundaries	ensure	merges	are	algebraically	equivalent	to	sequential	processing

This	leads	to	a	three-phase	algorithm:	parallel	local	reduction,	deterministic	merge,	and	final	fold.

## N.2	Stack	State	Representation

An ordered	reduction	state summarizes	a	contiguous	range	as	an	ordered	sequence	of	fully	reduced	power-of-two blocks.

For	a	contiguous	range R ,	the	state	may	be	viewed	as	a	sequence:

```
[B0,	B1,	...,	Bm]
```

where	each Bi is	the	canonical	reduction	of	a	contiguous	subrange	of R ,	the	subranges	are	disjoint	and	appear	in strictly	increasing	stream	order,	each	block	size	is 2^k ,	and	the	block	sizes	are	strictly	decreasing.	The concatenation	of	these	subranges	equals R .

The	stack/bucket	representation	below	is	one	concrete	way	to	store	this	ordered	block	sequence	and	to	implement the	canonical	'coalesce	equal-sized	adjacent	blocks'	rule	used	by	shift-reduce.

A stack	state compactly	represents	a	partially	reduced	sequence	as	a	collection	of	buckets:

```
template <size_t	L> struct StackState	{ static constexpr size_t	MAX_DEPTH	=	32; double	buckets[MAX_DEPTH][L]; //	buckets[k]	holds	2^k	blocks	worth	of	reduction size_t	counts[MAX_DEPTH]; //	lane	counts	(L	for	full,	<L	for	partial) uint32_t	mask; //	bit	k	set	iff	buckets[k]	is	occupied };
```

Invariant: If mask has	bits	set	at	positions	{k₀,	k₁,	…,	kₘ}	where	k₀	<	k₁	<	…	<	kₘ,	then	the	state	represents	a	prefix of	length:

```
num_blocks	=	2^k₀	+	2^k₁	+	...	+	2^kₘ
```

Each buckets[kᵢ] holds	the	fully	reduced	L-lane	vector	of	a	contiguous	block	of	2^kᵢ	input	blocks. Lower-indexed buckets	represent	more	recent	(rightward)	blocks;	higher-indexed	buckets	represent	older	(leftward) blocks.

## N.3	The	Push	Operation

The	push	operation	incorporates	a	new	L-lane	vector	into	the	stack	state,	implementing	binary-counter	carry propagation:

```
void	push(StackState&	S,	const	double*	vec,	size_t	count,	size_t	level	=	0)	{ double	current[L]; copy(vec,	current,	count); size_t	current_count	=	count; while (S.mask	&	(1u	<<	level))	{ //	Bucket	exists:	combine	(older	on	left) current	=	combine(S.buckets[level],	S.counts[level], current,	current_count); S.mask	&=	~(1u	<<	level); //	Clear	bucket ++level; //	Carry	to	next	level } S.buckets[level]	=	current; S.counts[level]	=	current_count; S.mask	|=	(1u	<<	level); }
```

Key	property: Processing	element	i	triggers	carries	corresponding	to	the	trailing	1-bits	in	the	binary	representation of	i.	This	exactly	mirrors	the	canonical	pairwise	tree	structure.

## N.4	The	Fold	Operation

After	all	blocks	are	pushed,	the	stack	is	collapsed	to	a	single	vector:

```
double*	fold(const	StackState&	S)	{ double	acc[L]; size_t	acc_count	=	0; bool	have	= false ; //	CRITICAL:	Iterate	low-to-high,	bucket	on	LEFT for (size_t	k	=	0;	k	<	MAX_DEPTH;	++k)	{ if (!(S.mask	&	(1u	<<	k))) continue ; if (!have)	{ acc	=	S.buckets[k]; acc_count	=	S.counts[k]; have	= true ; } else { //	Higher	bucket	(older)	goes	on	LEFT acc	=	combine(S.buckets[k],	S.counts[k],	acc,	acc_count); } } return acc; }
```

Critical	detail: The	fold	must	iterate	from	low	to	high	indices,	placing	each	bucket	on	the left of	the	accumulator. This	reconstructs	the	canonical	tree's	final	merges	where	older	(leftward)	partial	results	combine	with	newer (rightward)	ones.

## N.5	Power-of-2	Aligned	Partitioning

For	multi-threaded	execution,	we	partition	the	block	index	space	among	threads. The	critical	requirement	is	that partition	boundaries	fall	on	power-of-2	aligned	indices.

Definition: A	block	index	b	is k-aligned if	b	is	a	multiple	of	2^k.

Observation: After	processing	blocks	[0,	b)	where	b	=	m	×	2^k,	the	stack	state	has	no	occupied	buckets	below level	k.

The	binary	representation	of	b	has	zeros	in	positions	0	through	k-1.	Since	bucket[j]	is	occupied	iff	bit	j	is	set	in	the count	of	processed	blocks,	buckets	0	through	k-1	are	empty.

Consequence: When	thread	boundaries	are	power-of-2	aligned,	the	'receiving'	state	A	has	no	low-level	buckets that	could	collide	incorrectly	with	the	'incoming'	state	B's	buckets	during	merge.

## N.6	Partition	Strategy

Given	B	total	blocks	and	T	threads,	choose	chunk	size	C	=	2^k	where	k	is	the	largest	integer	such	that	B	/	2^k	≥	T:

```
size_t	choose_chunk_size(size_t	num_blocks,	size_t	T)	{ if (num_blocks	<=	T) return 1; size_t	k	=	bit_width(num_blocks	/	T)	-	1; return size_t{1}	<<	k; }
```

This	yields	ceil(B	/	C)	chunks,	each	having	C	blocks	(except	possibly	the	last).	Thread	t	processes	chunks	assigned	to it,	producing	a	local	stack	state	for	each.

Example: For	B	=	1000	blocks	and	T	=	4	threads,	C	=	128	(2^7),	giving	⌈1000/128⌉	=	8	chunks:

|   Thread | Chunks   | Blocks      | Output                                     |
|----------|----------|-------------|--------------------------------------------|
|        0 | 0-1      | [0, 256)    | Two buckets at level 7, merged locally     |
|        1 | 2-3      | [256, 512)  | Two buckets at level 7, merged locally     |
|        2 | 4-5      | [512, 768)  | Two buckets at level 7, merged locally     |
|        3 | 6-7      | [768, 1000) | Bucket at level 7 + remainder (104 blocks) |

Full	chunks	(128	=	2^7	blocks)	produce	exactly	one	bucket	at	level	7.	The	remainder	chunk	(104	=	64	+	32	+	8) naturally	decomposes	via	shift-reduce	into	buckets	at	levels	{6,	5,	3}.

## N.7	The	Merge	Operation

To	combine	two	stack	states	where	A	represents	an	earlier	(leftward)	portion	of	the	sequence	and	B	represents	a later	(rightward)	portion:

```
void	merge_into(StackState&	A,	const	StackState&	B)	{ //	Process	B's	buckets	in	increasing	level	order for (size_t	k	=	0;	k	<	MAX_DEPTH;	++k)	{ if (B.mask	&	(1u	<<	k))	{ //	Push	B's	bucket	into	A,	starting	at	level	k	(NOT	level	0!) push(A,	B.buckets[k],	B.counts[k],	k); } } }
```

Critical	detail: push(A,	B.buckets[k],	B.counts[k],	k) starts	at	level	k,	not	level	0.	This	correctly	reflects	that B.buckets[k]	represents	2^k	already-reduced	blocks.

Why	low-to-high	order: Within	B's	stack	state,	lower-indexed	buckets	represent	more	recent	(rightward)	elements within	B's	range.	Processing	them	first	ensures	they	combine	before	higher-indexed	(older)	buckets,	matching	the canonical	left-to-right	order.

## N.8	Correctness	argument

Claim: The	multi-threaded	algorithm	produces	a	result	bitwise	identical	to	single-threaded	shift-reduce	under	the same	floating-point	evaluation	environment	(§6),	for	any	number	of	threads	T	≥	1	and	any	input	size	N.

Argument:

1. Shift-reduce	correctness: Single-threaded	shift-reduce	evaluates	the	canonical	pairwise-with-carry	tree.	The push	operation's	carry	pattern	exactly	mirrors	binary	increment,	corresponding	to	completing	subtrees	of	size 2^k.
2. Alignment	property: For	a	prefix	of	length	b	=	m	×	2^k	blocks,	the	stack	state	has	no	occupied	buckets	below level	k	(see	observation	above).
3. Merge	correctness: merge\_into(A,	B) produces	the	same	state	as	processing	A's	blocks	followed	by	B's	blocks sequentially.	By	the	alignment	property,	when	B	starts	at	an	aligned	boundary,	A	has	no	buckets	below	the alignment	level.	B's	buckets,	when	pushed	at	their	native	levels,	trigger	exactly	the	carries	that	would	occur from	processing	B's	blocks	after	A's	blocks.	The	low-to-high	iteration	order	preserves	within-B	ordering.
4. Combining	these: Thread	boundaries	are	aligned,	so	merge	correctness	applies	to	each	merge.	The	left-to-right merge	order	(thread	0,	then	1,	then	2,	…)	matches	sequential	block	order.

## N.9	Complete	Algorithm

```
template <size_t	L> double	deterministic_reduce_MT(const	double*	input,	size_t	N,	size_t	T)	{ const	size_t	num_blocks	=	(N	+	L	-	1)	/	L; const	size_t	C	=	choose_chunk_size(num_blocks,	T); const	size_t	num_chunks	=	(num_blocks	+	C	-	1)	/	C; vector<StackState<L>>	states(num_chunks); //	Phase	1:	Parallel	local	reductions parallel_for(0,	num_chunks,	[&](size_t	chunk)	{ size_t	b0	=	chunk	*	C; size_t	b1	=	min(b0	+	C,	num_blocks); states[chunk]	=	replay_range(input,	N,	b0,	b1); //	sequential	push()	over	blocks	[b0,	b1) }); //	Phase	2:	Serial	merge	(left-to-right	order) for (size_t	i	=	1;	i	<	num_chunks;	++i)	{ merge_into(states[0],	states[i]); } //	Phase	3:	Final	fold	+	cross-lane	reduction double*	lane_result	=	fold(states[0]); return cross_lane_pairwise_reduce(lane_result); }
```

## N.10	Complexity	Analysis

The	semantics	do	not	require	parallel	scalability.	This	section	explains	that	the	canonical	expression admits scalable multi-threaded	realizations.

| Phase                            | Work         | Span (critical path)   |
|----------------------------------|--------------|------------------------|
| Local reduction                  | O(N) total   | O(N/T)                 |
| Ordered merge (sequential)       | O(T · log N) | O(T · log N)           |
| Ordered merge (tree- structured) | O(T · log N) | O(log T · log N)       |
| Final fold                       | O(log N)     | O(log N)               |

Total	work: O(N	+	T·log	N) (typically O(N) when T	<<	N )

Span: With	a	tree-structured	merge, O(N/T	+	log	T	·	log	N) .

Space: O(T	·	L	·	log	N) for	per-thread	states	(typically	a	few	KB	per	thread,	depending	on L ).

## N.11	SIMD	Optimization:	8-Block	Unrolling

A	significant	optimization	reduces	stack	operation	overhead	by	processing	8	blocks	at	once:

```
//	Instead	of	pushing	one	block	at	a	time: for (size_t	b	=	0;	b	<	num_blocks;	++b)	{ push(S,	load_block(b),	L,	0); //	O(num_blocks)	stack	operations } //	Process	8	blocks	in	one	SIMD	reduction,	push	at	level	3: for (size_t	g	=	0;	g	<	num_groups_of_8;	++g)	{ double	result[L]; reduce_8_blocks_simd(input	+	g	*	8	*	L,	result); //	8	blocks	→	1	vector push(S,	result,	L,	3); //	Start	at	level	3	(since	8	=	2^3) }
```

This	reduces	stack	operations	from	N/L	to	N/(8L),	yielding	substantial	performance	improvements.	The	reference implementation	achieves	throughput	exceeding std::reduce while	maintaining	the	canonical	expression	contract.

## N.12	Performance	Observations

The	reference	implementation	at [GB-x86-MT-PERF] demonstrates:

| Variant                                 | Throughput   | vs std::accumulate   |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| std::accumulate                         | 5.4 GB/s     | baseline             |
| std::reduce                             | 21.4 GB/s    | +297%                |
| Deterministic ST (L=16, 8-block unroll) | 26.5 GB/s    | +391%                |
| Deterministic MT (L=16, T=2)            | 21.2 GB/s    | +293%                |

Key	finding: With	proper	SIMD	optimization,	deterministic	reduction	is faster than	non-deterministic std::reduce while	guaranteeing	run-to-run	bitwise	reproducibility	within	a	fixed	floating-point	evaluation	environment	(§6).	The 8-block	unrolling	minimizes	stack	overhead,	and	the	interleaved	lane	structure	enables	efficient	vectorized combines.

## N.13	Implementation	Notes

Thread	pool	reuse: For	production	implementations,	reuse	a	thread	pool	rather	than	spawning	threads	per invocation.	The	reference	limits	thread	creation	for	Godbolt	compatibility.

Parallel	merge	(optional): The	merge	phase	can	itself	be	parallelized	using	a	tree	structure:

<!-- image -->

This	reduces	the	merge	critical	path	from	O(T)	to	O(log	T),	though	for	typical	T	values	the	improvement	is	marginal compared	to	the	dominant	O(N/T)	local	reduction	phase.

Memory	efficiency: Stack	states	are	fixed-size	(O(L	×	log	N)	per	state)	with	no	heap	allocation	required	during	the hot	path.	The	merge	operation	modifies	A	in-place,	requiring	only	register-level	temporaries	for	the	carry	chain.

## N.14	Summary

The	multi-threaded	stack	ordered	state	merge	algorithm	achieves:

| Property     | Guarantee                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Determinism  | Expression-identical to the single-threaded canonical expression for any T under the specified partition/merge scheme; bitwise identity additionally requires a matching floating-point evaluation model (§6) |
| Correctness  | Equivalent to the canonical pairwise tree (argument outlined in Appendix N)                                                                                                                                   |
| Efficiency   | O(N) work, O(N/T + T log N) span                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Practicality | Demonstrated competitive with, and in some configurations faster than, std::reduce with SIMD on the tested platforms/harness                                                                                  |

The	key	insights	enabling	this	approach	are:

1.  Power-of-2	aligned	partitioning	eliminates	boundary	ambiguity
2.  Stack	states	are	complete	representations	of	partial	reductions
3.  Pushing	at	native	levels	during	merge	preserves	the	canonical	tree	structure
4.  8-block	SIMD	unrolling	amortizes	stack	overhead

This	shows	that	a	fixed	abstract	expression	structure	(canonical	expression)	is	compatible	with	high-throughput SIMD	execution.	The	constraint	of	a	canonical	tree	enables	aggressive	unrolling	and	predictable	memory	access, achieving	throughput	comparable	to	unconstrained	implementations	in	the	tested	configurations.

GPU	implementations	may	place	the	O(log	N)	working	state	per	lane	in	shared	memory	rather	than	thread-local registers,	avoiding	register	pressure	while	preserving	evaluation	of	the	identical	canonical	expression.	This	is	a standard	GPU	reduction	pattern	and	does	not	require	changes	to	the	semantic	contract.

## Appendix	O:	Recursive	Bisection	('Balanced')	Tree	Construction	(Informative)

This	appendix	records	a	previously-considered	alternative	canonical	tree	construction	based	on	recursive	bisection. It	is not part	of	the	normative	contract	in	§4;	this	paper	specifies	iterative	pairwise	(§4.2.3)	as	the	sole	canonical tree	definition.

## O.1	Definition

Define CANONICAL\_TREE\_EVAL\_RECURSIVE(op,	Y[0..k)) ,	where k	>=	1 and	each Y[t] is	in maybe<A> :

```
CANONICAL_TREE_EVAL_RECURSIVE(op,	Y[0..k)): if	k	==	1: return	Y[0] let	m	=	floor(k	/	2) return	COMBINE(op, CANONICAL_TREE_EVAL_RECURSIVE(op,	Y[0..m)), CANONICAL_TREE_EVAL_RECURSIVE(op,	Y[m..k)) )
```

## O.2	Equivalence	on	power-of-two	sizes

For k	=	2^n (k	=	2,	4,	8,	…),	recursive	bisection	and	iterative	pairwise	produce	identical	trees,	and	therefore	define identical	abstract	expressions.

## O.3	Differences	on	non-power-of-two	sizes

For	non-power-of-two k ,	the	trees	differ	in	structure	(but	keep	the	same	asymptotic	depth	bounds).

Example	( k	=	5 ),	writing + for op :

```
Recursive	bisection: (e0	+	e1)	+	(e2	+	(e3	+	e4)) Iterative	pairwise: ((e0	+	e1)	+	(e2	+	e3))	+	e4
```

## O.4	Rationale	for	selecting	iterative	pairwise

This	paper	selects	iterative	pairwise	as	the	sole	canonical	tree	definition	for	the	following	reasons:

- Industry	alignment: SIMD/GPU	deterministic	reductions	commonly	use	adjacent	pairwise	combination patterns.
- Direct	hardware	mapping: iterative	pairing	corresponds	directly	to	SIMD-lane	and	warp-lane	pairing operations.
- Adoption	continuity: existing	deterministic	implementations	can	conform	without	structural	change.
- Specification	focus: once	a	single	canonical	tree	is	selected,	keeping	alternatives	in	the	normative	contract increases	complexity	without	adding	semantic	value.

(Normative	rule	in	§4:)	No	other	grouping	is	permitted.

## Appendix	P:	Performance	and	Regret	(Informative)

This	appendix	records	performance	and	regret	considerations	for	the	choice	of	iterative	pairwise	(shift-reduce)	as the	canonical	tree	construction	rule	(§3.8).	These	considerations	are	informative	and	do	not	affect	the	semantic contract	specified	in	§4-§5.

## P.1	Performance	comparison:	iterative	pairwise	vs	recursive	bisection

Because	both	trees	have	identical	depth	for	power-of-two	sizes	and	nearly	identical	depth	otherwise,	their throughput	is	similar	on	modern	hardware.	Recursive	bisection	can	be	implemented	with	a	direct	unrolled	mapping for	small	sub-problems	(e.g.,	a	flat	switch	for	N	≤	32	eliminates	recursive	call	overhead),	and	unaligned	SIMD	loads on	contemporary	microarchitectures	are	essentially	free	when	data	does	not	cross	a	cache	line	boundary	reducing	the	alignment	advantage	that	earlier	analyses	relied	on	[Dalton2014].	The	iterative	formulation	keeps structural	advantages	(loop-based	with	a	branchless	bit-test	for	reduction,	natural	streaming	order),	but	these translate	to	modest	rather	than	dramatic	throughput	differences	against	a	well-engineered	recursive implementation.

This	approximate	throughput	equivalence	between	the	two	candidates	means	that	performance	alone	cannot distinguish	them	-	and	the	decision	appropriately	falls	to	the	axes	where	they	do	differ:	industry	practice alignment,	executor	compatibility,	and	the	fact	that	iterative	pairwise	is	what	existing	SIMD	and	GPU	reduction libraries	already	ship.	This	paper	does	not	claim	iterative	pairwise	is	faster	than	recursive	bisection;	it	claims	that, at	equivalent	performance	and	identical	error	bounds,	the	tree	that	matches	existing	practice	is	the	lower-risk standard	choice.

Executor	compatibility. Once	the	expression	is	separated	from	execution	(§3.0),	the	question	becomes:	which expression	can	executors	naturally	evaluate?	Iterative	pairwise	produces	a	local,	lane-structured	expression	that maps	directly	to	executor	chunking	and	work-graph	execution	without	requiring	the	full	tree	to	be	materialized.

Recursive	bisection	produces	a	globally-recursive	structure	that	is	harder	to	realize	incrementally.	In	executor terms,	iterative	pairwise	defines	an	expression	that	executors	can	evaluate	without	first	building	the	tree.

## P.2	Standard	regret

Once	standardized,	the	tree	shape	becomes	part	of	the	language	contract	and	cannot	be	changed	without	breaking code	that	depends	on	specific	results.	The	consequence	of	choosing	iterative	pairwise	is	commitment	to	a	specific non-power-of-two	boundary	behavior.	For	power-of-two	sizes	the	two	candidates	are	identical;	the	commitment applies	only	to	non-power-of-two	boundary	cases,	where	iterative	pairwise	matches	existing	SIMD/GPU	practice.	Of the	two	candidates,	iterative	pairwise	is	most	closely	aligned	with	existing	implementations.

## P.3	Upper	bound	on	regret

Regardless	of	tree	shape,	any	balanced	binary	reduction	has	the	same	O(log	N	·	ε)	error	bound	[Higham2002].	No alternative	tree	can	improve	the	asymptotic	accuracy.	On	the	throughput	side,	iterative	pairwise	already	achieves 89%	of	the	theoretical	peak	[Dalton2014].	Even	if	a	superior	tree	shape	were	discovered	in	the	future,	Dalton	et al.	report	roughly	89%	of	peak	throughput	on	their	setup;	this	suggests	limited	headroom	in	that	environment,	but the	exact	gap	is	configuration-dependent.

## P.4	Measured	throughput	cost

The	practical	performance	cost	of	iterative	pairwise	(shift-reduce)	summation	has	been	measured	by	Dalton,	Wang &	Blainey	[Dalton2014].	Their	SIMD-optimized	implementation	achieves	89%	of	the	throughput	of	unconstrained naïve	summation	when	data	is	not	resident	in	L1	cache	(86%	from	L2,	90%	streaming	from	memory),	while providing	the	O(log	N	·	ε)	error	bound	of	pairwise	summation	-	and	twice	the	throughput	of	the	best-tuned compensated	sums	(Kahan-Babuška).

The	more	telling	comparison	is	against	the	current	deterministic	baseline.	Today,	the	only	standard	facility	with	a fully	specified	expression	is std::accumulate ,	which	is	a	strict	left	fold	with	a	loop-carried	dependency	chain.	In general,	that	dependency	prevents	full-width	SIMD	parallelism	without	changing	the	expression,	so	utilization	can be	far	below	the	SIMD	width	(e.g.,	a	single	running	scalar	corresponds	to	~1/8	of	AVX-512 double lanes	or	~1/16	of float lanes	in	an	idealized	utilization	model).	The	canonical	iterative	pairwise	tree,	by	contrast,	exposes independent	operations	that	map	naturally	to	SIMD	lanes	and	can	approach	memory-bandwidth	limits	in	tuned implementations	(e.g.,	~89%	of	peak	in	the	literature	for	non-L1-resident	data).	Interpreting	these	figures	as utilization	rather	than	guaranteed	speedups,	the	canonical	tree	can	recover	most	of	the	SIMD	parallelism	that	a strict	left	fold	cannot	generally	access.

The	throughput	and	regret	analyses	above	establish	that	neither	candidate	has	a	decisive	performance	advantage. The	distinguishing	property	is	architectural:	iterative	pairwise	is	the	only	common	candidate	that	can	be	evaluated incrementally	without	global	sizing	-	a	structural	alignment	with	the	sender/receiver	execution	model	adopted	for C++26	(see	§3.8.2	and	§3.10).

## Appendix	Q:	Historical	Note	on	Span-Based	Topology	(Informative)

Earlier	explorations	of	this	facility	considered	specifying	the	reduction	topology	in	terms	of	a	fixed	byte	span M ,	with the	corresponding	lane	count	derived	as:

L	=	M	/	sizeof(value\_type)

This	formulation	aligns	with	common	implementation	concerns	such	as	cache-line	size,	SIMD	register	width,	or hardware	batch	size,	and	may	be	convenient	for	numerics	workflows	that	target	a	specific	memory	or	vector	width.

However,	because sizeof(value\_type) is	implementation-defined,	a	span-based	topology	does	not,	in	general,	select the	same	abstract	expression	across	different	platforms	or	ABIs.	For	example, sizeof(long	double) may	differ between	implementations	on	the	same	architecture,	causing	the	same	source-level	span	value M to	produce	different lane	counts L and	therefore	different	parenthesizations	of	the	reduction	expression.

Since	the	topology	coordinate	intentionally	determines	the	abstract	expression	evaluated	for	non-associative operations,	such	variation	would	undermine	the	cross-platform	expression	identity	this	proposal	seeks	to	provide.

For	this	reason,	the	semantic	topology	parameter	in	§4	is	defined	solely	in	terms	of	the	lane	count L .	API	designs that	derive L from	a	byte	span	may	be	considered	in	future	revisions	as	layout-oriented	conveniences	for environments	where	representation	size	is	known	and	fixed,	but	such	facilities	would	not,	in	general,	denote	the same	abstract	expression	across	implementations.
