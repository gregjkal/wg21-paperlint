## 3

As discussed in [P3948R0], because of language inconsistencies, std::constant\_wrapper is inconsistently not unwrapping for call and subscript operators whereas all other operators can be found via ADL and the conversion operator implemented in constant\_wrapper . Looking at std:: reference\_wrapper we see that this same issue has been resolved via an operator() overload that unwraps and applies INVOKE .

I always had these unwrapping overloads in my implementation of constant\_wrapper shipping in the vir-simd library 1 ( vir::constexpr\_wrapper ). While replacing my implementation with std:: constant\_wrapper I noticed the mismatch.

## 3.1

design principle

The following has always been my thinking on what constant\_wrapper is / needs to be, which informed all my opinions on its API: constant\_wrapper exists to be able to use function arguments in place of template arguments .

- As a template argument passing a 1 the function sees an int .
- As a function argument passing a cw<1> the function does not see an int but a constant\_-wrapper<1, int> ; I actually wanted an int .

Therefore, constant\_wrapper<X> should transparently unwrap into X whenever possible (similar to reference\_wrapper unwrapping to the reference it holds), except if it can stay in the type space, in which case it unwraps all operands/arguments and wraps the result.

it's the thing it holds, unless it can stay wrapped

This leads to the following expectations:

constexpr int iota[4] = {0, 1, 2, 3}; cw<1> + 1 → 2 the thing it holds cw<1> + cw<1> → cw<2> can stay wrapped cw<iota>[1] → 1 the thing it holds cw<iota>[cw<1>] → cw<1> can stay wrapped cw<fun>(1, 2) → fun(1, 2) the thing it holds cw<fun>(cw<1>, cw<2>) → cw<fun(1, 2)> can stay wrapped ∗ cw<fun>(cw<1>, 2) → fun(cw<1>, 2) the thing it holds cw<unary>() → cw<unary()> can stay wrapped ∗ ∗ fun(1, 2) and unary() need to be constant expressions, otherwise unwrap.

status quo examples

```
auto test1() { constexpr int iota[4] = {0, 1, 2, 3}; auto x = std::cw<iota>; return x[1]; // #1 OK } auto test2() { auto x = std::cw<std::array< int , 4> {0, 1, 2, 3}>; return x[1]; // #2 ill-formed }
```

The subscript in #1 is fine because x is convertible to int[4] and because operator lookup is different for built-in types, the built-in subscript operator is found and int(1) is returned. The subscript in #2 does not work because, even though array<int, 4> is an associated namespace and x is convertible to array<int, 4> , the array::operator[] member function is not found. This is because only hidden friend operators are considered via ADL. Note how ADL makes the following work for operator+ :

```
struct X { friend int operator +(X, int a) { return a + 1; } }; auto test3() { auto x = std::cw<X{}>; return x + 1; // #3 OK }
```

The expression x + 1 in line #3 fi nds X::operator+ via ADL and thus converts the left operand to operator+ to X , returning int(2) .

The situation for operator() is equivalent:

```
int fun( int x) { return x + 1; } auto test1() { auto x = std::cw<fun>; return x(1); // #4 OK } auto test2() { auto x = std::cw<[]( int x) { return x + 1; }>; return x(1); // #5 ill-formed }
```

The call expression in #4 relies on special core wording that looks through the conversion operator to find the function pointer and then call the function. The expression in #5 , however, cannot find the operator() member of the lambda, because the operator is a member, not a hidden friend.

## 4 DISCUSSION

The most glaring question on this issue is why would we do this for operator() and operator[] but for none of the other operators. This seems inconsistent. However, we need to realize that the inconsistency is in the language, forcing the inconsistent definition of operators in the library. This makes the behavior of the API, where operators unwrap transparently, more consistent. After all, the conversion operator and the additional type template argument in constant\_wrapper exist exactly because constant\_wrapper is supposed to transparently unwrap.

Wouldn't it then be better to fix the language?

For what it's worth, I think it would be a hugely helpful change to make the behavior of all operators as consistent as possible. Currently, every operator has its own set of restrictions and extras. If I could, I'd make every operator overloadable as non-member (and thus hidden friend) and implement all operators of standard library types as hidden friends. But the amount of code we would break … The only possibility that is not a breaking change is to add syntax that opts into new behavior, which has a high acceptance barrier.

In terms of consistency we also have std::reference\_wrapper to consider. The similar naming is not accidental. Consequently, the unwrapping behavior should also be consistent.
