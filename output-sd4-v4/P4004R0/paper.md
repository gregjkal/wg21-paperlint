## Abstract

This  paper  proposes  to  reconsider  the  resolution  of  CWG  1395  by  reverting  most  of  it,  standardizing existing practice (or something close to existing practice).

## Introduction

CWG 1395 "Partial ordering of variadic templates reconsidered" was raised to address the ambiguity for a trailing function parameter pack:

```
template<class T> void print(ostream &os, const T &t) { os << t; } template <class T, class... Args> void print(ostream &os, const T &t, const Args&... rest) { os << t << ", "; print(os, rest...); } int main() { print(cout, 42); print(cout, 42, 1.23); }
```

However,  the resolution that was  finally accepted (as  a  DR)  was  far  more  widereaching  and fundamentally changed the way function parameter packs are handled during partial ordering. 10 years later only EDG implements that approach and gets bugs reports for real-world code where users expect a different partial ordering result.

## Examples

```
template<typename ... T> char *f(T &...); // #1 template<typename T>      int *f(T &&);   // #2 int i; auto *p = f(&i);
```

GCC, Clang, and MSVC all pick #2 (preferring the non-variadic template), but with the resolution  of CWG 1395, #1 should be chosen.

During  partial  ordering,  we  try  to  deduce  template  parameters  (after  transforming  function  parameter types, including dropping references and cv-qualifiers [temp.deduct.partial]/5-7) in each direction. Prior to CWG 1395, trying to deduce a non-pack from an argument pack always failed, resulting in #1 to not be at  least  as  specialized  as  #2  (and  ultimately  making  #2  more  specialized).  But  with  the  resolution  for CWG 1395, instead of failing deduction from an argument pack early, we now instead attempt to deduce

- 2 - from  the  the  type  of  the  pack  for  each  remaining  parameter  type.  This  deduction  succeeds,  and  the deduction in the other direction also succeeds (as we have removed references at this point). We then get into  a  tie-breaker  for  lvalue  vs.  rvalue  references  in  [temp.deduct.partial]/9  which  makes  #1  more specialized. The pack vs. non-pack tie-breaker in [temp.deduct.partial]/11 is not considered.

Let's  now  have  a  look  at  the  CWG 1825 "Partial  ordering  between  variadic  and  non-variadic  function templates" example:

```
template <class ...T> int f(T*...)  { return 1; } // #1 template <class T>  int f(const T&) { return 2; } // #2 void g() { f((int*)0); }
```

Prior  to  CWG  1395,  this  was  ambiguous  as  deduction  failed  in  both  directions.  With  CWG  1395, however, deduction of #2's parameters from #1 succeeds, making #1 more specialized. GCC and MSVC currently chose #2, and Clang says it's ambiguous.

This  example  is  very  similar  to  the  previous  one,  so  at  least  entirely  different  results  shouldn't  be expected.  But  the  mechanics  in  partial  ordering  are  different,  and  unlike  the  previous  example,  the function  template  specialization  parameter  types  are  not  identical  here,  having  an  additional  reference binding. Of course, such a difference wouldn't usually affect overload resolution.

## Additional issues with the current wording

With  the  current  wording  (after  CWG  1395),  there  is  no  normative  wording  for  Example  1  in [temp.deduct.partial]/8:

```
template<class... Args>           void f(Args... args);         // #1 template<class T1, class... Args> void f(T1 a1, Args... args);  // #2 template<class T1, class T2>      void f(T1 a1, T2 a2);         // #3 f(); // calls #1 f(1, 2, 3);  // calls #2 f(1, 2);     // calls #3; non-variadic template #3 is more specialized // than the variadic templates #1 and #2
```

The  tie-breaker  in  [temp.deduct.partial]/11  doesn't  actually  cover  these  cases,  making  the  latter  two function calls in the example ambiguous.

Another potential issue with the current wording was pointed out in CWG 3154 "Clarify partial ordering involving variadic templates", i.e.

```
template<typename ...T> void f(T*...); // #1 template<typename U> void f(U, U); // #2
```

With  the  current  wording,  #1  would  be  chosen,  and  the  pre-CWG  1395  wording  would  make  it ambiguous (similar to what CWG 3154 proposes).

## Conclusion

Having a feature specified in a way almost no one implements is not really useful, particularly if there are additional issues with that specification that need to be fixed. And as real-world code breaks with the rules as  specified,  I  am  not  expecting  other  implementers  to  update  their  implementation  any  time  soon.  It therefore seems reasonable to specify existing practice (or something close to existing practice).

## Option 1

Revert  the  changes  in  [temp.deduct.partial]/8  from  CWG  1395,  only  keeping  the  tie-breaker  in [temp.deduct.partial]/11.

This  would  make  the  first  example  in  this  paper  pick  #2  and  make  the  example  from  CWG  1825

- 3 - ambiguous. It would also restore the normative wording needed for the example in [temp.deduct.partial]/8.

## Option 2

Make the example from CWG 1825 choose overload #2 instead of making it ambiguous.

## Wording for Option 1 (relative to N5032)

Change [temp.deduct.partial] paragraph 8 as follows:

Using If A was transformed from a function parameter pack and P is not a parameter pack, type deduction fails. Otherwise, using the resulting types P and A, the deduction is then done as described in [temp.deduct.type]type of the argument template is compared with the type P of the declarator-id of  the  function  parameter  pack.  Each  comparison  deduces  template  arguments  for  subsequent positions in the template parameter packs expanded by the function parameter pack.  Similarly, if A was transformed from a function parameter pack, it is compared with each remaining parameter type of  the  parameter  template. If  deduction  succeeds  for  a  given  type,  the  type  from  the  argument template is considered to be at least as specialized as the type from the parameter template.

- Keep [temp.deduct.partial] paragraph 11 unchanged:

If, after considering the above, function template F is at least as specialized as function template G and  vice-versa,  and  if  G  has  a  trailing  function  parameter  pack  for  which  F  does  not  have  a corresponding parameter, and if F does not have a trailing function parameter pack, then F is more specialized than G.
